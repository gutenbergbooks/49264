<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="pch">THE JOYS AND SORROWS OF A
FLYING-MAN</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">IT was in the month of August of the
year 1913 when I arrived in my
native town, Schwerin. I had stayed
several weeks in England, where I had
devoted days to the visit of museums and
the beautiful art collections, as well as to
excursions in the vicinity of the capital.
At that time I did not foresee how useful
the latter would prove to me two years
hence.</p>

<p>During the whole journey I was labouring
under an inner excitement and disquiet
which I could not throw off, and when I
arrived in Schwerin one question only
burned on my lips, and yet I did not dare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
put it to my uncle who fetched me from
the station. For the new Naval List of
autumn promotions and appointments might
be issued any day, and I was on the tiptoe
of expectation as to whether the wish I
had cherished for years was at last to be
gratified.</p>

<p>My uncle’s question: “Do you know
where they’ve put you?” gave me an
electric shock.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, hearty congratulations&mdash;Naval
Flying Corps!”</p>

<p>I was so overjoyed that I would like to
have turned a somersault in the middle of
the street, but I refrained from fear of
upsetting my fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>So I had got my wish after all!</p>

<p>The last days of my leave passed in a
flash, and I gaily returned to the Naval
College in order to complete my course of a
year and a half as Inspecting Officer; but
I never packed my trunks with greater
pleasure than when bound for my new
destination.</p>

<p>Just a few days before my departure one
of my brother officers called out to me: “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
say, have you heard the latest news where
you’re off to?”</p>

<p>“Yes; Flying Corps.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord, man! You don’t know
your own luck&mdash;why, you’re off to Kiao-Chow.”</p>

<p>I was speechless, and probably looked as
stupid as I felt.</p>

<p>“Yes; Kiao-Chow! And in the Flying
Corps! You lucky devil&mdash;to be the First
Naval Flying Officer at Kiao-Chow!”</p>

<p>It is hardly surprising that I refused to
believe this until I received the official
confirmation. But it was true. I had
tremendous luck!</p>

<p>I had to wait three months longer at Kiel;
but at last, on the 1st of January 1914, I
found myself in my beloved Berlin. But there
was no holding me; I was at Johannisthal
on the 2nd of January already, and thought
I could start flying on the spot. My experience,
however, was that of the majority
of flying-pupils. I learnt for the first time
the time-honoured principle of flight:
“Keep cool; who wants to fly must above
all things learn to wait.”</p>

<p>Wait, wait, and once more wait. Eighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
per cent of the science of flying consists in
waiting and holding oneself in readiness.</p>

<p>Winter had come and covered the aerodrome
with a deep, white carpet, making
flying impossible. For weeks every morning
I had the hope that the snow would melt at
last, and every afternoon I returned home
disappointed.</p>

<p>In February at last the weather changed.
On the 1st of February I sat happily in my
Taube, and for the first time rose into the glorious
clear winter air. It was beautiful now;
and every day our schooling progressed.</p>

<p>Flying suited me, and I grasped it quickly.
And I was very proud that on the third day
I was allowed to fly alone. Two days later,
on a beautiful Saturday afternoon, my untiring
instructor, Werner Wieting, asked
me whether I would not care to create a
nice little record by passing my examination
as pilot. I enthusiastically agreed.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later I sat in my machine,
circling gaily in the prescribed curves. It
was a real joy to keep going in the lovely
winter air. And when I achieved a perfect
landing, which concluded my examination,
and my teacher proudly shook me by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
hand and congratulated me, I felt extremely
happy and filled with a sensation of inner
satisfaction.</p>

<p>At last I was a pilot. The school-stage
was over, and from now onwards I could fly
daily on one of the big 100 h.p. machines.</p>

<p>One particular undertaking was to be the
source of much pleasure to me. Rumpler
had just completed a monoplane which was
specially designed for climbing. It now
became our aim to achieve a high-altitude
flight record. The famous pilot, Linnekogel,
was to fly the machine, and he
asked me to accompany him as observer.
It was only natural that I accepted with
delight.</p>

<p>On one of the last days in February we
started on our first trial trip. Warmly
wrapped up against the severe cold, we
sat in our machine, and many eyes followed
us with envy as our bird rose in the air with
the lightness of a dragon-fly. Watch in
hand, I noted the altitude, and after fifteen
minutes we had already reached 2000
metres, which at that time was considered
an extraordinarily good performance. But
after that we only progressed slowly. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
atmosphere became bumpy, and we were
flung about like feathers by violent eddies
or bumps. After an hour we had at last
reached 4000 metres, when with a popping
and spluttering noise the motor began to
run irregularly, and stopped altogether after
a few seconds. We now descended in spirals
towards the earth, and some minutes later
the machine stood unharmed on the flying-ground.</p>

<p>The cold had been too great, and the motor
was simply frozen&mdash;a circumstance which
nobody had foreseen. New improvements
were promptly added. After a few days
we started again on the same adventure,
but this time better luck seemed in store
for us. We climbed steadily and securely
4000 metres, 4200, 4500 metres. Thank
God, our last record was broken! The cold
was well-nigh unbearable, and I am convinced
that the thickest hide would have
been no protection against it.</p>

<p>4800, 4900 metres! 400 more and our
object was attained. But the machine
seemed bewitched, and refused to climb
another metre! All our attempts to induce
an extra effort failed. We were running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
short of petrol, and the engine gave out
completely this time.</p>

<p>An altitude of 4900 metres! We landed,
without a single drop of petrol, nearly
frozen to ice. We had not achieved <i>all</i> we
had set out to do; however, it was a good
result. We had won, and won brilliantly,
the German high-altitude record.</p>

<p>But success made us ambitious. At the
beginning of March weather conditions
again improved sufficiently to allow us to
try our luck once more. More warmly
clad than last time, and fitted out with
thermometers, though without an oxygen
apparatus, we started on our third attempt.</p>

<p>We reached the first altitude with ease.
The sky was covered with huge clouds, the
air icy. When we rose through the bank
of clouds into the glorious sunshine we
had a beautiful experience. We suddenly
saw a radiantly shining Zeppelin, which
was likewise attempting a flight at high
altitude.</p>

<p>What a marvellous meeting&mdash;3000 metres
up in the air! Far away from toiling
humanity, high up above daily strife and
pain, the two birds of the air&mdash;striking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
evidence of Germany’s strength and enterprise&mdash;saluted
each other.</p>

<p>We flew several times round our big
brother, and waved our hand to him in
friendly greeting.</p>

<p>But after that we had to apply ourselves
seriously to our task and work strenuously
in order to attain our objective. After an
hour we had gained an altitude of 4800
metres, after that 4900, my barograph soon
showed 5000, and the propeller hummed
its monotonous melody. Linnekogel veered
quietly and methodically. The thermometer
rose to 37 degrees Celsius; but we
paid no attention to the cold. Only the
air became rarefied. A slight sensation of
drowsiness came over me, and my lungs
only functioned in quick, short gasps.
Every movement became irksome. Even
to turn round towards the pilot who sat
behind me seemed a huge effort.</p>

<p>The sky had cleared and looked glorious.
The cloud-banks had vanished, and we
could distinguish our capital lying far below
us in the blue distance like a black spot,
on which, however, we could still note
the straight line of the Charlottenburger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Chaussee, culminating in the thoroughfare
Unter den Linden.</p>

<p>I was so carried away by this view that
for some time I paid no attention to either
watch or barograph. But I suddenly
realized my omission with a start. Twenty
minutes had passed since I had registered
my barograph at 5000 metres, and by now
we should have beaten our record. But I
was terribly disappointed to see that the
needle still indicated 5000. At the same
time, Linnekogel began signalling to me to
look for the aerodrome, pointing downwards
with his hand. That was too bad.
I turned away disgustedly, and, when
Linnekogel failed to notice it, I kicked
his shin with none too much gentleness. I
likewise spread out my five fingers and
pointed upwards. This meant: Higher,
higher! We have only got to 5000 metres!</p>

<p>Linnekogel only laughed. He gripped
my hand, shook it hard, and opened and
shut the five fingers of his right hand twice.
I really thought he had gone dotty. And
what confirmed me in my opinion was that
Linnekogel throttled the engine. We were
just above Potsdam, and glided towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the aerodrome of Johannisthal. It was now
my job to find the landing-place. And
sixteen minutes later we stood safe and
sound before the Rumpler-hangars, joyfully
acclaimed by crowds of spectators.</p>

<p>We had done it! The world’s record
was broken with 5500 metres.</p>

<p>The flight had only lasted an hour and
three-quarters in all. We stood proudly
amongst our less fortunate fellow-mortals
who had remained on terra firma. Linnekogel
was right. My barograph had frozen,
whilst his&mdash;better protected&mdash;resisted the
high temperature.</p>

<p>The days passed, and the time came when
I had to leave my country.</p>

<p>My Taube, which had been specially
constructed for Kiao-Chow, neared its completion,
and with a curious feeling I took
it out on its trial flight, after it had fulfilled
the requisite conditions for acceptance. I
was conscious that it was the most beautiful
flying-machine in the world.</p>

<p>But my ambition was not yet realized. It
seemed imperative that before I left for the
Far East I should carry out an important
overland flight in Germany.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>I was lucky. My request met with ready
response from Herr Rumpler, and he
kindly allowed me the use of one of his
aeroplanes for a several days’ flight over
Germany. I quickly passed my examination
as field-pilot, and at the end of March,
one fine morning at 7 a.m., I sat in my well-equipped
Taube, and in the seat in front
of me, tall and slim, my good friend Oberleutnant
Strehle of the War Academy as
observer.</p>

<p>It was the first time he had ever been in
an aeroplane. But I think he will never
forget his first flight as long as he lives.</p>

<p>We started brilliantly. And proudly I
took off, until having reached an altitude
of 500 metres I proceeded in a northerly
direction. Everything went well. We
passed over the Havel lakes, sighted Nauen;
but suddenly the atmosphere became thick
and murky and our bad luck set in. We
were wrapped in a thick fog and could see
nothing of the ground. For the first overland
flight of my young life it was a tall
order. But, with the fine confidence of the
novice, I consoled myself with the thought
that courage was everything&mdash;even if things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
couldn’t help getting worse! And I flew
calmly into the thick fog, directing myself
by my compass towards the north, as our
objective was Hamburg. After two hours
we could make out the ground again at a
distance of 300 metres below us, and who
can describe our joy on espying a beautiful,
large, ploughed field! I glided down gently,
just as though it were an aerodrome, and
landed safe and sound in the middle of the
field. People came running from all sides,
and my joy was great when I learned that
we were on good Mecklenburg soil, and
exactly where, according to my own and my
observer’s calculations, we had expected
to find ourselves. It was a holiday, and we
afforded the villagers a free entertainment.</p>

<p>As soon as it cleared up, we decided to
depart. But the soft soil held the wheels
fast, and it was impossible to rise. With
shrieks of merriment, and many a rough
jest which we had to accept, the willing
spectators trundled the giant bird over the
field.</p>

<p>After we had cut down a few trees, we
had to negotiate a ditch and another field.
Though we now intended to depart, we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
only allowed to do so after partaking of
most excellent coffee and pound-cake.</p>

<p>After a mighty hand-shaking all round,
and shouting themselves hoarse with endless
“Hurrahs,” with much waving of handkerchiefs,
we started off on a northerly course.</p>

<p>But our joy was short-lived, for fifteen
minutes later we were again in the midst of
grey fog-banks. After two hours I found
the situation getting unpleasant, for the
confounded motor began to choke and spit,
and was either 500 revolutions short or
registered 200 too many.</p>

<p>I examined my landing-gear and valves,
and noticed to my horror that my provision
of petrol was diminishing with hideous
rapidity. I kept my machine balanced as
well as possible, and glided down to a
height of 300 metres.</p>

<p>But, oh, Lord! The mist lifted a little
and I could see where I was&mdash;exactly over
the river Alster at only 300 metres’ altitude,
and this with a motor that was running dry,
and with no idea where to look for the
aerodrome of Fuhlsbüttel. There was only
one thing to do&mdash;and that was to keep calm
and cool! Above all, to get away from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
town and thus avoid imperilling human
lives. I pencilled these words on a scrap
of paper and passed them to my observer:
“We must land within five minutes or we
shall take a cold bath, as we have no more
petrol.” He peered about him and suddenly
pointed joyfully to a cemetery which lay
right under us. Good old chap! He had
no idea of our predicament and could not
guess what unconscious irony lay behind
his gesture.</p>

<p>We had already dropped 200 metres.
The engine was working by fits and starts;
the level of the petrol showed 10 litres.
But I was pleased. For we had now left
the town behind us, and though a smooth
landing was impossible, amongst all these
suburban gardens, at least I hoped to
avoid killing anyone. At such times every
second seems an eternity, and my thoughts
chased each other across my brain. But
more than ever I had to show iron determination
and self-control.</p>

<p>My observer suddenly started waving his
hand and pointing forwards. And even now
I can see his sparkling eyes shining at me
through his goggles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>The sheds of the Fuhlsbüttel aerodrome,
shimmering in the rays of the setting sun
faintly encircled by the mist, lay before us.</p>

<p>Hurrah! We were saved.</p>

<p>Who can describe my joy? With my
last litre of petrol I described a loop round
the aerodrome and, gliding down in a steep
spiral, landed.</p>

<p>I nearly fell on my observer’s neck, so
happy did I feel. The dear old chap had
no inkling of the danger in which we had
been, and was very surprised when I told
him about it. Even now, when I know what
flying means, I go cold when I think of this
first flight. I soon found out what had
happened. The lower part of the carburettor
was damaged, and the petrol leaked through
the fracture with each throb of the engine.
This also explained the rapid sinking of the
petrol and the irregular working of the
engine. To this day I cannot understand
why there was no fire.</p>

<p>After spending three days with dear friends
in Bremen the new carburettor arrived in
Hamburg. Now, we wanted to move on
to our next destination&mdash;Schwerin in Mecklenburg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>On a rainy, stormy afternoon we settled
ourselves in our fully equipped aeroplane.
I started the engine and took on full throttle.</p>

<p>To-day I would only fly in such weather
if I absolutely could not help it. But at
that time I was still imbued with all the
<i>naïveté</i> and enthusiasm of a young pilot.
But we had not long to wait for new developments.
The machine, which was too heavily
freighted, could not rise&mdash;gusts of wind
threw it from side to side like a ball&mdash;and I
would have turned back with pleasure.
But at that height it was impossible.</p>

<p>And now came the first houses of Hamburg&mdash;it
was impossible to rise above them. I
was flying at 60 metres when I saw a small
field. Throttling my engine, I got ready
to land, but at the same moment I was
caught in a squall and felt the aeroplane
slide away under me. The thought went
through my mind, “Careful, you are falling!”
and I opened up my engine momentarily in
order to weaken the shock. But at the
same moment I felt a sharp jerk, and the
machine stood on its head as if some one
were tilting it downwards.</p>

<p>What followed only took seconds. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
pulled at my lever, shut off the petrol, and
at the same time received a sharp, heavy
blow. I clutched convulsively at my steering-wheel,
and flew into the air, hitting my
head against some part of the machine.</p>

<p>A deathly silence reigned around me.</p>

<p>Deep darkness; from which I was only
roused by feeling a stream of pungent
liquid pouring over my face.</p>

<p>I lay motionless, my head pressed forward,
my body huddled together, feet sticking out.
But suddenly I realized my position with a
start, and, obsessed by the fear of the machine
catching fire at any moment, I tried to free
myself from my cramped position, until I
succeeded in switching off the ignition.
At last I gradually regained complete consciousness
of my surroundings, and my first
thought was for my poor observer. I felt
sure that as he sat in front he must have
borne the brunt of the first shock and was
probably crushed to a pulp, as the fuselage
had splintered under the impact. As no
sound broke the silence, I gasped at last&mdash;for
I was so squeezed in that I could hardly
breathe:</p>

<p>“Strehlchen, are you alive?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>A dreadful pause; no answer.</p>

<p>On repeating my question, I heard at
last: “I say, what has happened? It is
quite dark here&mdash;something <i>must</i> have
happened!”</p>

<p>Ah, how glad I was! I shouted with
the rest of my strength: “Strehlchen, man,
you are still alive&mdash;that’s all that matters!
What about your bones? Are they
whole?” But the poor chap was lying so
huddled up that he was only able to gasp:
“I don’t know. We’ll see later on.”</p>

<p>Again silence supervened. The petrol
flowed in a rich stream from the tank, which
held its full capacity of 170 litres; but
after a time, which seemed an eternity,
somebody knocked outside, and a far-away
voice floated to where we lay:</p>

<p>“Well, anybody still alive?”</p>

<p>“Rather,” I called out, “but hurry up,
or we shall suffocate in here.”</p>

<p>We heard the machine being lifted, then
the grating of spades, and at last a current
of fresh air blew in on us.</p>

<p>“Hold hard!” shouted Strehle. “Try the
other way round or you’ll break my arm.”</p>

<p>Our helpers followed my instructions, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
at last I was lifted clear from my seat,
and I lay softly and at ease on an odorous
manure heap. Long-legged Strehle promptly
clambered out of the debris, and I have
rarely shaken hands with more pleasure
than with my faithful observer.</p>

<p>Dash it all! Things did look bad. The
machine had completely toppled over, and
was deeply embedded in the soft manure.
The fuselage was broken in three places; the
planes had turned into a tangled mass of
wood, fabric and wire.</p>

<p>But we two were safely out of it. Strehle
had sprained his back slightly, and I had
only broken two ribs. That was all. Never
again have I despised a manure heap. May
that one and its like flourish for ever. Sadly
and limpingly we covered the rest of the
return journey by train. After that, however,
we enjoyed many days of sunshine and
light, full of happy doings and happier
memories, which we collected like flowers of
rare beauty and bloom.</p>

<p>And then duty called, and the real voyage
began.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="pch">BEAUTIFUL DAYS IN KIAO-CHOW</p>

<p class="drop-cap05">FOR days the train took me farther
and farther through the steppes
and desert spaces of Russia towards
my destination&mdash;the Far East.</p>

<p class="pn">Mukden at last! We soon passed Peking.
Then&mdash;Osinanfou! The first German sounds
again smote upon my ear. And then for
ten hours we passed through a beautifully
cultivated country full of gardens, fields
and flowers; and at last the train slowly
steamed into the station of Kiao-Chow.</p>

<p>I thus saw it again after six years! Once
more I stood on German soil, in a German
city of the Far East!</p>

<p>My brother officers met me. The Mongolian
ponies pranced off and carried me to
my new home.</p>

<p>At first we went to Iltis Place, which was
our race-course, and was at the same time
destined to become my aerodrome. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
festively decorated, for all Kiao-Chow had
foregathered to watch a big football match
between German sailors and their English
comrades from the English flagship <i>Good
Hope</i>.</p>

<p>The latter was on a visit at Kiao-Chow,
and the game was brilliant and ended in a
draw&mdash;one all.</p>

<p>Who could have foreseen this? A short
six months hence these same adversaries
opposed each other in a terrible game, which
admitted but of two issues&mdash;victory or
death. At the battle of Coronel the
German bluejackets sent the English flagship
<i>Good Hope</i> to her doom at the bottom
of the Pacific in twenty-seven minutes.</p>

<p>But on that day none knew of the events
to come and, united by bonds of sincere
friendship, the German sailors invited their
English guests to their cantonments. Two
days later the English Squadron left our
port followed by our Cruiser Squadron under
Admiral Count von Spee.</p>

<p>The flags fluttered gaily in the wind, conveying
the signals of the two admirals in
command: “Farewell&mdash;until we meet
again!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Who could foresee that it would be at
Coronel?</p>

<p>Immediately after my arrival, and after I
had reported myself officially, I looked
round for my aeroplane, in hopes of being
able to show the amazed citizens of Kiao-Chow
my beautiful giant bird. But&mdash;&mdash;!
I had to curb my eagerness, for my machine
was sailing jauntily round India and the
steamer only due in July. “What can’t
be cured must be endured,” I said to myself,
and now had plenty of time to look round
Kiao-Chow and to choose a house. A delightful
little villa, quite close to the flying-ground,
stood vacant, and I promptly took
possession of it with my new comrade,
Patzig. I had everything now to make me
happy: my excellent billet at Kiao-Chow&mdash;this
paradise on earth&mdash;work after my own
heart, and, to cap it all, this charming
residence, perched high on an eminence,
with a lovely view on to Iltis Place and the
distant, dark blue sea. Apart from this,
I belonged to the Cavalry Detachment, and
three happy years lay before me. Who
could be more contented than I? I now
set about arranging my house. I had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
great number of plates on interior decoration,
and with these I visited a Chinese cabinet-maker
and ordered the furniture. It is
marvellous with how much skill the Chinese
are able to imitate our models, in what a
short time, and how cheaply. When, four
weeks later, everything was shipshape, the
different pieces standing in their proper
places, and the whole house shining with
cleanliness, the masters of the house proudly
took possession of their new abode. Nothing
was lacking. Even servants were provided.
If a European wishes to stand well with the
Chinese, he must surround himself with a
considerable number of Chinese servants;
and one may affirm it is practically the
moral duty of every European to do so.</p>

<p>Maurice, the cook, in his lovely blue
silken Ishang; Fritz, the Mafu (groom), a
perpetual grin on his face, but very concerned
about the welfare of his horses;
Max, the gardener, as lazy as a slug; and
August, the pert little “boy,” composed our
staff.</p>

<p>To this must be added “Herr” Dorsch
and “Herr” Simon.</p>

<p>These two gentlemen were our batmen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
who took the fullest advantage of the custom
of the Far East, that a European must do
no manual labour in the presence of a
Chinese.</p>

<p>Our house was surrounded by a big
garden, which also contained the stables,
the coach-house, the garage and the huts
of the Chinese. To me the most important
was my hen-coop. As soon as I arrived I
bought myself a sitting-hen, gave her a
dozen eggs to hatch, and when we entered
our house we already had seven chickens.</p>

<p>Poultry is cheap in China. The hen cost
fourpence, a duck or a goose a shilling, and
in a short time I had a poultry-yard of fifty
birds.</p>

<p>And, as I had also become a cavalryman,
I had, of course, acquired a horse. One
of my friends had a ripping little roan.
We soon clinched our bargain, and “Fips”
was transferred to my stables. “Fips”
was a delightful animal, a good service-horse,
yet excellent for hunting and polo,
which did not prevent him from leaving me
in the lurch at the beginning of the Kiao-Chow
siege. I had ridden out into the
territory the day before we were shut up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the fortress, and he took fright at some
shrapnel which burst close to us, and so ran
over to the enemy.</p>

<p>Life in the East was very monotonous for
the Europeans. Very little socially, no
music, no theatre&mdash;things one misses. One’s
only consolation is that one lives better than
at home, and sport makes up for a great deal.
I took up polo with enthusiasm, and as soon
as I had accustomed myself to the unusual
pitching and tossing to which my horse
subjected me I was very successful.</p>

<p>In mid-July my longing was stilled by
the arrival of the steamer which brought
the aeroplanes. As soon as the huge crates
stood in the quay, my men were already
engaged in freeing from their dark prisons
my poor birds born for sunshine and air.
As they were too heavy, the unpacking had
to be done on the spot. The Chinese crowd
stood around us and gaped. When we had
got everything out of the crates, a triumphal
procession was formed, bearing the two
aeroplanes, then three vehicles with the
planes and another two with the component
parts. The horses started, and we proudly
passed through the streets of Kiao-Chow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
and entered in triumph the aerodrome of the
Iltis Place.</p>

<p>Now there was an end to peace. Day
and night we worked at the erection of the
machine, and two days later, in the early
dawn, with no one awake, my aeroplane
stood ready on the aerodrome, and, opening
up the engine full, I shot into the clear sea-air.</p>

<p>I shall never forget my first flight at Kiao-Chow.
The aerodrome was extraordinarily
small, only 600 metres long and 200 metres
wide, full of obstacles surrounded by hills
and rocks. I was only to learn later how
very difficult starting and landing were made
hereby. My friend Clobuczar, an Austrian
ex-aviator&mdash;who now served on the <i>Kaiserin
Elisabeth</i>&mdash;once said to me: “Do you call
this an aerodrome? It is at best a children’s
playground. I have never seen anyone who
could fly in such a confined place.” I felt
the same way about it. And in Germany
I should have only used it for an emergency
landing.</p>

<p>But nothing could be done. It was the
one place in the whole Protectorate; all the
rest was composed of wild mountains cleft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
by deep ravines. But on that glorious,
sunny morning I only thought of my flight,
and frightened the placid inhabitants of
Kiao-Chow out of their beauty-sleep with
the humming of my propeller. But, when
it came to landing, I certainly felt a little
queer, for the field was decidedly small, and
I slowly circled round, getting gradually
lower&mdash;thus putting off the critical moment.
However, I could not stay up in the air for
ever, so I pulled myself together, shut off
the engine, and stood on the field a moment
later after a secure landing. Now I knew
where I was. And the rest of the morning
was spent in my aeroplane.</p>

<p>After that more work was in store for me.
The second machine, also a Rumpler-Taube,
which was to be flown by my colleague,
Leutnant Müllerskowski, of the battalion
of Marines, had to be erected and got into
working order. After two days, on the 31st
of July 1914, it was ready in the afternoon.
Müllerskowski entered his aeroplane and,
after receiving my parting instructions based
on my previous experience of the flying-field,
he took off.</p>

<p>But fortune did not smile on him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>His machine was only a few seconds in
the air, and had just reached an altitude of
50 metres&mdash;the critical spot where the aerodrome
and solid earth end in a steep cliff
with a sheer drop into the sea&mdash;when it
suddenly turned over on the wing, and we
could watch it nosing down with appalling
rapidity towards the rocks.</p>

<p>We hastened as fast as we could to the
spot. Matters looked bad. The machine
was completely wrecked, and between the
fragments we found Müllerskowski. We
brought him, seriously injured, to the
hospital, where he had to lie until shortly
before the end of the siege. Of the aeroplane
nothing remained.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile July had come, and
brought with it the loveliest weather, most
radiant sunshine, and the bluest of skies. It
was Kiao-Chow’s best month.</p>

<p>The bathing season was at its height.
There were many charming ladies, mostly
from the European and American settlements
in China and Japan, visiting the
“Ostend of the Far East” and enjoying
the beauty of Kiao-Chow.</p>

<p>Amusement was the order of the day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Motor drives, riding-parties, polo and tennis
filled the free hours, and in the evenings
dancing held undisputed sway. There were
many Englishwomen amongst the women,
and our relations were most pleasant and
cordial.</p>

<p>For the beginning of August we had
challenged the English Polo Club at Shanghai
to a match when, on the 30th of July&mdash;like a
bolt from the blue&mdash;came the order warning
us of “Danger of war!”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="pch">THREAT OF WAR&mdash;MY TAUBE</p>

<p class="drop-cap00">I REMEMBER it as if it were yesterday.
In the early hours of the morning an
orderly arrived at our villa and brought
Patzig and myself the order to report at
once to the Divisional Commander, as “Protection”
had been ordered. We naturally
imagined this only to be a manœuvre, and
grumblingly repaired to our rendezvous.
But there we received confirmation of the
hardly credible news. And, with doubt still
in our hearts, we hastened to our batteries
and began the necessary preparations.</p>

<p>The order, “Threatening danger of war,”
which arrived next day, brought us certainty
at last. It was followed on the 1st of August
by the mobilization, on the 2nd by the
declaration of war against Russia, and on
the 3rd by that against France.</p>

<p>It is impossible to describe those days.
And for this reason: here we were, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
German Colony, a German fortress, the
greater proportion of the Kiao-Chow population
consisting of officers and soldiers. Moreover,
to judge by externals, Kiao-Chow had
become international. Russians, French
and English lived with us as our guests. It
was a cross-current of opinions and feelings,
such as could hardly have been found elsewhere.</p>

<p>The main question&mdash;I should like to say
<i>the</i> question&mdash;which occupied all our minds
was: Will there be war with England?
Only those who have lived in the East can
judge what this question meant to us.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of August we were informed
of our offer to England. I rode out that day
with an English lady, and it was natural
that this subject should form the chief topic
of conversation. My companion’s opinion,
as that of all her friends, was that a war
between England and Germany was unthinkable,
as it would sound the death-knell of
the prestige of the white race, and give the
yellow Jap the opportunity of gathering
the fruits of our dissension.</p>

<p>Our minds, of course, were filled with this
contingency. The tension was even worse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
than during the first days of mobilization.
And when, on the 4th of August, we got the
news that war had been declared against
England, it came as a deliverance&mdash;the die
was cast in Europe!</p>

<p>It is impossible to pretend that we felt
particularly happy: quite the contrary.
Again and again we remembered that we
were far away in Kiao-Chow, whilst at home
those lucky devils, our brothers and comrades,
were rejoicing to the full in the glorious
days of mobilization. <i>They</i> were going to
war against a world of enemies, <i>they</i> were to
be allowed to defend our holy and beloved
Fatherland, their wives and children, whilst
we sat here, powerless to help! The
thought alone was enough to drive us mad.
For we knew that neither English, Russian
nor French, by whom we were so greatly outnumbered,
would find the courage to attack
us here. However, the hope persisted:
“Perhaps they will!” Oh, what a warm
reception we would have given them!</p>

<p>Of course no one for a moment thought
of Japan!</p>

<p>In the midst of all the work which the days
of mobilization brought in their wake, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
did not forget our guests. Nearly all of
them were enemies, but they remained our
guests.</p>

<p>Their excitement was comprehensible.
The more so, as news of the absolutely
brutal treatment of the Germans by the
English in the British Colonies was already
reaching us.</p>

<p>It was natural that we should break off
our relations with the foreigners, but it was
also a matter of course&mdash;and I should
particularly like to point this out to the
English&mdash;that all foreign subjects were treated
with a consideration to be expected from
“Huns” alone.</p>

<p>The foreigners were informed that they
could stay on or depart from Kiao-Chow
without any let or hindrance, and that the
Governor would give them due warning at
what time they would be expected to leave
the Colony. It was only requested that no
one should move beyond the confines of
the city, go near the fortifications, or carry
on espionage. Let who will compare this
with the behaviour of our dear cousins at
Hong-Kong and so many other places in
the world. All who went through these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
experiences could write volumes about them.
One consolation remained to us: the Daily
Wireless from home!</p>

<p>It is difficult to depict the delight with
which we received this news. Usually the
telegrams arrived in the evening, when we
sat in our little casino, our only conversation,
the war. When the glorious news of
victory reached us, our jubilation knew no
bounds. But in spite of this we felt an
immense sadness&mdash;for we were not with our
home armies!</p>

<p>The 15th of August arrived, and with it
a communication of such enormity that
we doubted the truth of what we read.</p>

<p>It ran as follows:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pc1 mid"><span class="smcap">Extra Edition</span></p>

<p class="p1">“We consider it most important and
necessary, with the object of maintaining a
secure and lasting peace in the Far East, in
accordance with the Anglo-Japanese Alliance
Treaty, to take at the present moment
every necessary measure to eliminate all
causes likely to endanger peace.</p>

<p>“First, to withdraw the German warships
at once from Japanese and Chinese
waters, also armed ships of any description,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and to dismantle those which cannot be
withdrawn.</p>

<p>“Secondly, to surrender the whole Protectorate
of Kiao-Chow forthwith&mdash;not later
than by the 13th of September&mdash;to the
Imperial Japanese Authorities without conditions
or claims of indemnity, with the
prospect of eventually returning the same
to China.</p>

<p>“The Imperial Japanese Government
announces at the same time that should it
receive any but an unconditional acceptance
from the Imperial German Government up
to the 23rd of August 1914, to all the above-mentioned
conditions, it will consider itself
obliged to take such measures as the situation
necessitates.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Our Governor had written below:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“It is a matter of course that we can
never consent to surrender Kiao-Chow to
Japan without drawing the sword. The
frivolity of the Japanese demand admits
but of one reply. But it implies that we
must reckon on the opening of hostilities
at the expiration of the date fixed. It will
be a fight to the finish.</p>

<p>“Having regard to the gravity of the
situation, we must proceed without further
delay with the evacuation of women and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
children. Our Government will therefore
place at their disposal a steamer prepared
for the reception of 600 passengers, in order
to convey them to Tientsin this day, Friday
morning. It is urged that all who do not
wish to stay here should take advantage of
this opportunity, as well as of the trains,
which are still running on the Shantung
line.</p>

<p>“Kiao-Chow clears for action!”</p></div>

<p class="p1">We now knew exactly where we were.
We had no illusions either as to the bitterness
or the outcome of the coming fight.
But never was work done in a higher or
more indefatigable spirit. A titanic task
was completed in these weeks. And, from
the oldest officer to the youngest fifteen-year-old
volunteer motorist, one and all
combined in placing their knowledge, their
ability, and endeavour at the service of
their love for their country, in order to put
Kiao-Chow in a state of defence.</p>

<p>I had experienced particularly bad luck.
Three days after Müllerskowski’s fall I
rose in wonderful sunshine to my first
important reconnaissance, and returned in
a happy frame of mind to Kiao-Chow, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
having explored the whole Protectorate for
hundreds of miles.</p>

<p>I was at an altitude of 1500 metres, and
in consequence of the atmospheric conditions
the landing was a particularly difficult
one. When I was about 100 metres over
the place, and putting on full engine, with
the object of flying round once more and
landing to back, the engine started knocking
and then stopped altogether. I only took
a second to examine my altimeter, but it
was sufficient to ascertain that the machine
was no longer capable of landing on the
aerodrome.</p>

<p>But I could veer neither to the right nor
to the left. On the right hand there was
the Polo Club and a deep ditch, on the left
the hotel and villas.</p>

<p>I knew there was nothing more to be
done, but I thought only of one thing: to
keep the engine from harm.</p>

<p>In front of me lay a small wood, and I
hoped to be able to negotiate it. I pulled
at the altitude lever, but in the hot, thin
air of the tropics the machine sagged heavily.
I just managed to keep my head clear of
the telegraph poles, then drew up my knees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
pressed my feet unconsciously forward, and
suddenly I felt a mighty shock, heard
cracking and splintering noises, and collided
heavily with the tank, after which all was
silent. But when I looked around me,
having miraculously escaped unhurt, I perceived
my Taube with its nose in the ditch,
its little tail high up in the air, and its wings
and under-carriage forming a confused mass
of broken wood, wires and canvas.</p>

<p>Oh, my poor little Taube! Would it
had not happened exactly on the third day
of the mobilization! I felt quite hopeless.
Yet, without entirely losing courage, I
carried the debris to the hangar. Luckily
I had received some reserve propellers and
planes from home.</p>

<p>My only hope was that the motor had
escaped! I did not possess any spares, and
it would have been impossible to procure
them. I made my way towards the boxes
in which the spares were kept, and first
opened those which contained the planes.
But, oh, horrors! A foul smell of decay was
wafted into our faces, and, fearing the worst,
we prised open the inner zinc lining.</p>

<p>The sight which met our eyes was perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
horrible. The box was full of mouldy
lumber. The covering of the planes had
rotted. The wing ribs and the different
wooden parts, which had been carefully
packed, lay in a disorderly heap and were
covered with a coat of mildew. It was a
sad spectacle. We now opened the case in
which were the propellers, where we found
the same conditions. The five propellers
had simply ceased to exist, and had shrunk
to such an extent that they could no longer
be of any use. It was a hard nut to
crack!</p>

<p>But, without losing courage, my splendid
rigger, Stüben, the chief mechanic, tackled
the job, and the same afternoon I sat with
Stüben, my two stokers, Frinks and Scholl,
and eight Chinese from the dockyards, hard
at work on the wings.</p>

<p>Thereafter I took the least damaged
propeller to the wharf, and was helped out
of my quandary, thanks to the excellent
patternmaker K. who, with the Chinese,
constructed a new propeller. This was a
real masterpiece, for it was hewn out of
seven thick oak planks which had been glued
together with ordinary carpenter’s glue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
The Chinese used their axes, and fashioned
a perfect propeller, copying a model which
K. had set up for them. Though done by
hand, their work showed the utmost care
and precision.</p>

<p>It is this propeller I used for all my flights
during the siege of Kiao-Chow.</p>

<p>But we had not remained idle in our sheds.
We worked day and night with the utmost
energy, and already, on the ninth day after
my accident, my little Taube stood ready
to run out on the aviation field at sunrise.
It is not difficult, though, to understand
that my expectations of a successful flight
were not very high. My planes had been
reconstructed from a mass of musty material,
and we had to rig them the best we could,
as we had no flat spaces. I have described
the erection of the propeller, which, by the
way, made about a hundred revolutions less
than it should have. Besides this, the conditions
for flying on this particular aerodrome
were so unfavourable that the choice lay
between a clean start and an irremediable
fall.</p>

<p>But I had no business to think of that.
We were in the midst of war. I was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
only aviator and had to carry on. And I
had luck!</p>

<p>In order to lighten my machine I had
scrapped every bit which I could do without.
Therefore in the beginning my bird rose
unwillingly to do my bidding, but soon I
had regained full control over it. Hereafter
I flew proudly, and dropped a message in
front of the Governor’s house: “Aircraft
again in perfect order!”</p>

<p>I then began my long reconnoitring
flights. I traversed the whole Protectorate,
and flew hundreds of kilometres beyond it
over the distant country, watching the ways
of approach, and spying out the wild rocks
of the coast, in order to see whether the
enemy was near&mdash;or landing. These were
the most beautiful expeditions of my life.</p>

<p>The air was so clear and transparent, the
sky of such a pure azure, and the sun shone
divinely and lovingly on the beautiful earth,
on the cliffs and mountains, and the deep
sea which hemmed the coast. My soul was
athirst for beauty, and revelled in the
marvellous sights of Nature for hours on end.</p>

<p>But I was not wholly without care. Already
on my second flight I was able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
ascertain that the glued grooves had split,
and that by a miracle alone the propeller had
not been torn asunder. It had, therefore,
to be disconnected and freshly sized. This
little performance had to be repeated after
every flight. As soon as I returned, the
propeller was taken off, I drove with my car
to the wharves, there it got a fresh coat of
mastic, was screwed under a press, and in
the evening I fetched it, fixed it on
the machine, and started afresh the next
day.</p>

<p>But, as the propeller insisted on splitting
regularly, I pasted the whole leading edge
with canvas-covering and sticking-plaster,
which helped a little towards holding it
together.</p>

<p>At Kiao-Chow, over and above my regular
duties, I was also in charge of the captive-balloon
section, which I jokingly called my
“swelled-headed competitors!”</p>

<p>Before I left Berlin I had passed through
a training course for dirigibles, learning to
pilot airships, in addition to some practice
with an observation balloon, and different
practical exercises like mending balloon-covers,
etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>The section, which was brand-new, consisted
of two huge balloons of 2000 cubic
metres each, a balloon-bag and all the
necessary accessories for producing gas and
for the service of the airships.</p>

<p>A petty officer, who had also had some experience
with airships, was the only person,
besides myself, who knew anything about it.
After we had unpacked all the cases, we went
very carefully about filling the balloons.
And we were extremely proud when the
first fat yellow sausage lay stoutly lashed
to the ground. I, personally, fastened
every line with my petty officer, and soon
after this the yellow monster was swaying
lightly under the blue canopy of the sky.
We hauled it down, and I clambered alone
into the gondola for the first ascent. On
this occasion I very nearly started on my
complicated voyage to Germany, for, when
the order “Let go!” was given, the rope,
which had been measured out too generously,
suddenly stiffened and got mixed up with
the cable, whilst the balloon shot out perpendicularly
50 metres into the air. The
thought that it was going to break away
flashed through my mind. A violent jerk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
nearly threw me out of the gondola. But as
the steel cable was also quite new it luckily
held. So I was none the worse, except for
having gained some fresh experience.</p>

<p>I then started drilling and instructing my
crew, and soon the show was being run with
the efficiency of old hands.</p>

<p>Our Governor expected great things of
the observation balloon. It was hoped that
it would be of great service in reconnoitring
the approach of the enemy and the
disposition of his artillery. These hopes
were doomed to disappointment, and my
fears that the erection of the balloons would
serve no useful purpose proved only too
justified.</p>

<p>Though I was able to send up the kite
balloon to 1200 metres from the ground, we
did not succeed in visualizing the range of
hills which lay behind our fortified positions,
thus observing the enemy’s movements and,
above all, the emplacement of his heavy siege
artillery. And this would have been of
capital importance to the defenders of Kiao-Chow.</p>

<p>The Protectorate of Kiao-Chow lies on a
narrow strip of promontory which stretches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
out into the sea, with the town of Kiao-Chow
framed on three sides by the sea and
partitioned off from the mainland by a chain
of mountains which has the form of a semicircle.
They are the Moltke, Bismarck
and Iltis Mountains. Our chief position
nestled among their crannies, and at their
foot lay the five infantry works with the
barbed-wire entanglements. Next came a
wide valley, which was bisected by the
river Haipo, and next a new range of hills,
which also stretched from sea to sea and
were doomed to bring disaster upon us.
Behind them there was another broad valley
surmounted by the wild rocky tips of the
Lau-Hou-Schan, the Yung-Liu-Chui and
the Lauchau.</p>

<p>It was most important for us to ascertain
what was happening in the open country, as
since the 27th of September we had been
completely shut off behind our barbed wire.
We were, above all, anxious to find out
<i>where</i> the enemy kept his siege artillery
and, as we had been disappointed in the
reliability of our observation balloon,
nothing remained but an occasional smart
reconnaissance and&mdash;my aeroplane!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>The days of August sped by in ceaseless
labour. Kiao-Chow and its approaches became
unrecognizable, and defensive positions
for artillery were opened. To our sorrow
the delightful little wood, which had been
planted with so much care, the pride of
Kiao-Chow, was felled by our axes to clear
the zone of fire. How sad to destroy at
one blow the loving work of “Kultur”!</p>

<p>The 23rd of August, the day on which the
Japanese ultimatum expired, broke at last,
and it is comprehensible that no answer
was vouchsafed to the yellow Jap. The
password was: “Go for them!” And this
was our dearest wish.</p>

<p>I remember that, on the following morning,
as I looked out from my balcony over
the wide blue sea I noticed at a distance
of some nautical miles several black shadows
which slowly moved to and fro. I was even
able to distinguish torpedo-boat destroyers
through my telescope. Patzig, who came
at a run to join my observations, also convinced
himself of this. Of course&mdash;was it
not the 24th? So the gang was blockading
us! And the Japanese had actually dared
to attack the German Empire!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>The fight of a yellow race, abetted by a
handful of Englishmen, against <i>one</i> German
regiment on a war footing had begun.</p>

<p>Immediately on the expiration of the
ultimatum a troop of one thousand men
moved into the extreme outposts of the
territory, in order to protect it as well as
the roads of approach. This little detachment
admirably fulfilled its task. It had
to defend a tract of land which was 30 kilometres
wide, and then another one of 10
kilometres, with quite insufficient artillery.
A thousand men had to replace two army
corps! They fought stubbornly and
courageously, sometimes only able to
oppose flying patrols to enemy battalions,
retreating step by step before the fearful
odds. Only on the 28th of September were
they pushed back behind the principal
retrenchments, which now definitely closed
upon us until the end of the combat.</p>

<p>During the early days of the siege I
must say that aeroplanes as well as aircraft
generally were held in small esteem by the
responsible authorities of the Kiao-Chow
garrison. This, one must admit, was only
natural, considering our luckless exhibitions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
However, a swift change soon took place.
One day I again flew over the south coast
of the Shantung peninsula, on the look out
for enemy ships or landing troops. The
coast appeared deserted, and there was
nothing to be seen. Much relieved that we
were safe from that side at least, I flew home.
Quite accidentally I went to Government
House in the evening to see a comrade there.
There I encountered by chance the head of
the General Staff, who was in a tearing
hurry as he had left an important conference
at the Governor’s in order to fetch a
book.</p>

<p>He called out to me as he was passing:
“Well, Plüschow, did you fly again?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” I said. “I have just returned.
I searched the coast for enemy
landing troops for several hours, but there
is no sign of them.”</p>

<p>I can still see the astounded expression on
our Chief’s face.</p>

<p>“What do you mean? Searched the
coast? And only tell us now? Here we
have been deliberating for the last two hours
how we can ward off the large convoys
which have been sighted by our scouts in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the Dsin-Dsia-Kou Bay. And you have
just come from there, and can produce such
unimpeachable evidence? In you go to
the Governor and report at once!”</p>

<p>The whole conference was now settled in a
few words. The scouts’ reports were, of
course, inventions. But I was happy, for
I had saved the reputation and the honour
of aviation!</p>

<p>And now began my most difficult, but
also most beautiful, flights.</p>

<p>I was soon to receive my baptism of fire.
It was during the first days of September,
on a Sunday, at an altitude of 1500 metres,
far out over the territory, basking in the
sunshine. I suddenly caught sight below of a
fairly important detachment of Japanese,
which greeted me with volleys of infantry
and machine-gun fire. I returned home,
exhibiting ten bullet holes in my planes.
But, in future, I did not descend below 2000
metres, thus avoiding unnecessary risks to
my engine and my propeller.</p>

<p>But the baptism of fire on land promptly
followed.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, I motored to Shatsy-Kou,
where we had advanced outposts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
I stopped before the house without thought
of danger. I was astonished to notice that
all the officers and men were lying flat on
the ground, along a stockade which was
erected seawards. They waved their arms,
which I naturally regarded as a greeting,
answering them promptly in the same
fashion.</p>

<p>I still sat in my car, when I heard a
sibilant whistle sounding close to my head,
followed by an ear-splitting crash not 10
feet away. A shell had exploded in the
masonry of the house, and before I could
recover from my surprise other projectiles
followed the first.</p>

<p>I threw myself out of the car and took
cover with the others. My brother officers
were splitting with laughter, for, however
serious the situation, I must have looked
a funny sight.</p>

<p>We then learned what had happened.</p>

<p>A Japanese destroyer-flotilla lay in front
and was trying to destroy Shatsy-Kou by
her fire. We spent the next two hours under
shell-fire, in our cramped and exposed
position, without being able either to see
or to move. At midday the Japs made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
pause, probably in order to enjoy their
dinner. While we examined the damage
done to the house, the Chinese boys were
already eagerly collecting shell-splinters.
And, as we sat down for a moment to a cup
of coffee, three small Chinks arrived with
radiant faces, and planked three unexploded
shells down in front of us. It would have
made a fine mess if they had gone off then!</p>

<p>We started soon after on our return
journey; but as we entered the first valley
new shells exploded behind us&mdash;the bombardment
was resumed.</p>

<p>A little later Shatsy-Kou had to be
evacuated with the whole Protectorate, and
on the 28th of September we retreated behind
the principal retrenchments, and at the same
time the first bombardment on a large scale
was started from the sea.</p>

<p>“Some” noise!</p>

<p>In the early morning of that day I sat
in my bath in the best of spirits, refreshing
myself before a long flight, when I heard the
most appalling noise. As our artillery had
been active day and night, I did not pay
much attention to this additional racket,
but attributed it to the firing of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
28-centimetre howitzer of the Bismarck
battery, which lay at the foot of my villa,
and had so far kept silent to economize our
ammunition.</p>

<p>I sent out my batman to see that my aeroplane
was kept in readiness. But after a
very few minutes he returned breathless and
a little pale, and reported: “Sir, we must
leave the villa at once; we are being bombarded
by four big ships. One of the heavy
shells has just landed near the sheds, but,
thank God, the aeroplane is not damaged,
and no one is hurt. But I burnt my fingers.
I saw such a beautiful large splinter, and
wanted to carry it away as a souvenir; it
was <i>so</i> hot, but I got it, all the same!”
And he beamingly showed me his singed
pocket-handkerchief, which held the huge
splinter of a 30-centimetre shell! But I
was already out of my bath, and in two
minutes had reached the aerodrome where,
with combined efforts, we pushed my aeroplane
into a more sheltered corner of the field.
After that I ran to look at the bombardment
from the Shore-commander’s guard-house.</p>

<p>The latter lay on a hill, from which one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
had an ideal view of Kiao-Chow. One could
follow the flight of every shell, and from now
onwards, whenever I was not flying, I sat
up here during the next weeks, watching the
fight.</p>

<p>The first bombardment of Kiao-Chow took
place on the 28th of September, and was
particularly impressive.</p>

<p>The crashing and bursting of the shells,
with their accompanying roar, was accentuated
by the echo from the surrounding
mountains. Crash followed upon crash, and
we had the impression that the whole of Kiao-Chow
was being turned into a heap of ruins.
It was a weird feeling, but we soon got used
to it. One is completely helpless in the
face of exploding shells, and can but wait
until all is over, whilst hoping that one
may be mercifully far away from the spot
on which they fall.</p>

<p>How despicable the English must have
felt during this bombardment and those that
followed!</p>

<p>The enemy ships stood so far out that our
guns could not reach them. Therefore, they
were quite safe. In the van steamed three
Japanese battleships, and under Japanese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
command, at the rear, the English battleship
<i>Triumph</i>.</p>

<p>I wonder whether the English felt proud
of their rôle as executioners?</p>

<p>Thank God, the damage caused by the
bombardment was not of much consequence,
and from then on we awaited their cannonading
with the greatest calm.</p>

<p>In the evening I witnessed a particularly
sad performance. Our gunboats, <i>Cormoran</i>,
<i>Iltis</i> and <i>Luchs</i>, were sunk by us after they
had been dismantled.</p>

<p>It was a tragic sight. The three ships
were fastened together and towed by a
steamer into deep water and there blown up
and burnt. It seemed as if the three ships
knew that they were being dragged to their
doom. They looked infinitely sad and helpless,
with their bare masts sticking up heavenwards,
and their frames writhed in the
fire, as if they were unwilling to turn into
ashes, until the waves swept over them and
put an end to their torment. Our sailors’
hearts were wrung with pity. These three
were followed by <i>Lauting</i> and <i>Taku</i>, and,
shortly before our surrender, by the little
<i>Jaguar</i> and the Austrian cruiser, <i>Kaiserin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Elisabeth</i>, after these two ships had
rendered us invaluable service. Their work
fills one of the most glorious pages in the
history of the fight and death of Kiao-Chow.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="pch">SOME JAPANESE JOKES</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">WE were greatly puzzled by the
activity of the Japanese besieging
army. After the first bombardment
we all thought that the Japanese
would try to carry the fortress by assault,
as they could not fail to know how weak
we were, and that but a single wire entanglement
stood between them and us.</p>

<p>The wildest rumours were circulated in our
midst: “The Japanese dare not attack us,
as things are going so well for us in Europe!”
or “The Americans are sending their fleet
to our assistance, and will force the Japs to
retire!” And then again, “The Japs only
want to starve us out; they want Kiao-Chow
to fall into their hands with as little damage
as possible!”</p>

<p>But we never got beyond mere conjectures.
Quietly and systematically, and without
our being able to prevent them, the Japanese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
landed their troops, constructed roads and
railways, brought up heavy artillery and
ammunition, entrenched themselves before
our entanglements and slowly worked towards
our defence-line.</p>

<p>I now started on my principal job&mdash;to
reconnoitre the position of the enemy’s
heavy batteries.</p>

<p>Every day, whenever the weather permitted&mdash;and
the propeller!&mdash;in the early
dawn, as soon as it was light, I started on my
travels into the unknown. And when the
sun rose I hung like a silver speck high up in
the ether, circling for hours round the enemy’s
positions, and overlooking the whole of our
beloved Protectorate invaded by an impudent
enemy, who meant to corner and
destroy us.</p>

<p>My work was hard, but I enjoyed it,
and it was crowned with success, and the
enemy’s unceasing efforts to shoot me down
convinced me that I <i>was</i> successful.</p>

<p>As I mentioned before, I was now the only
aviator at Kiao-Chow&mdash;“the Master-Bird
of Kiao-Chow,” as the Chinese called me.
Also I had but a single Taube at my disposal.
I had to be careful and take no unnecessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
risks, otherwise there would have been an
end to my job.</p>

<p>This was the way I carried out my reconnoitring.</p>

<p>As soon as I was flying right over the
enemy I throttled my engine in such a
fashion that it kept the altitude of its own
accord. I then hung my map on the stick,
took a pencil and a notebook, and observed
what was happening below through the
space between the planes and the tail.
I let go the stick, and steered solely with
my feet.</p>

<p>I then circled round a position until I
had thoroughly mastered its details, made a
sketch of them, and entered them in my
notebook. I soon acquired such proficiency
that I was able to write and draw uninterruptedly
for an hour or two. When I felt
the back of my neck getting stiff, I turned
round and looked down on the other side.
I did this until I was satisfied with my notes,
and sometimes I was so carried away by my
work that I had to be warned by a glance
at my petrol-recorder that it was high time
I went home.</p>

<p>I always returned the same way. I flew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
round the wharves and the town in proud
circles, and when I reached my aerodrome
I shut off the engine and shot down to earth
in a steep, gliding flight, which landed me
safe and sound in four minutes. For it was
necessary to be quick. Infantry and
machine-gun fire were continuously directed
at my aeroplane while it flew over the
enemy’s positions; when this proved of no
avail, the enemy used shrapnel, and this
was most objectionable.</p>

<p>The Japanese always had new surprises
in store for me. One day, for instance&mdash;a
day of blue sky and glorious sunshine&mdash;as
I was returning from a reconnaissance and
about to land, I saw a great number of
fleecy white clouds, which looked perfectly
delightful seen from above, hovering over
my aerodrome at an altitude of about 300
metres.</p>

<p>But I soon noticed that the Japanese were
trying on one of their little jokes, for these
pretty cloudlets were caused by the firing
of 10½-centimetre shrapnels!</p>

<p>There was nothing to be done but to
grind one’s teeth and fight one’s way through.
Four minutes later my machine dropped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
from an altitude of 2000 metres, and I
pushed it as quickly as I could under a
shed, whose roof was protected by earth.</p>

<p>I had now to resort to ruse.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when still hovering over the
enemy camp, I suddenly shut off my engine
and swooped down perpendicularly on to a
corner of my aerodrome, so that the Japs
were convinced that they had winged me.
By the time they recovered from their
surprise I was already pushing my machine
into safety, their shrapnel bursting much too
late.</p>

<p>But, as I tirelessly returned, the Japanese
retaliated by posting two of their 10½-centimetre
batteries so far behind and so much on
the side that their shrapnel easily reached me
whilst I was circling over their heads. It
was very unpleasant, and my fate would
often have been sealed but for my nimbleness
in taking a sharp turn and thus evading
a hit.</p>

<p>The shrapnels then burst so near that in
spite of the noise of the engine I could
hear the ugly bark of the explosion and
feel the violent air-pressure that sent
my aeroplane rolling like an old barge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
at sea, which made observation extremely
difficult.</p>

<p>I must say that each time I landed
safely I felt an overwhelming pride and
satisfaction in my achievement, and halloed
joyously with the full power of my lungs.</p>

<p>After hours of the greatest exertion and
danger, I again felt solid earth under my
feet, and in spite of guns and shrapnel.</p>

<p>As soon as I touched ground my four
helpers came on the run, fearless of danger
from the hail of shrapnel, and helped me
to stow away my machine. My faithful
dog, Husdent, jumped around them, barking
joyously.</p>

<p>And whilst the four were busy getting my
aeroplane ready for the next flight, I already
sat at the steering-wheel of my car, all my
maps and reports in my pocket, with Husdent
at my side, and again raced along the
road under shrapnel fire to Government
House, where my reports were being eagerly
awaited.</p>

<p>I believe anybody will sympathize with
my joy and pride when I was allowed to
present my drawings and observations. For
on some days I had been able to discover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
as many as five or six enemy batteries, and
often my observations filled four pages of the
report forms.</p>

<p>The warm handshake with which the
Governor and the Head of the Staff thanked
me for my work was reward enough.</p>

<p>And whilst I drove homewards, in order
to lunch and take a much-needed rest, I
already heard the thundering of our guns
as they hurtled their iron hailstones into
the positions of the enemy just discovered
by me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="pch">MY WAR RUSE</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">HOW sad and desolate it now looked
in my little house!</p>

<p>Immediately at the beginning of
the siege, my good Patzig was obliged to leave
me and to rejoin his 21-centimetre Battery-commander.
He had only luxuriated for
four weeks in the possession of our beautiful
little home, and now he sat in his redoubt
and fulfilled his duty until he had fired his
last shell and the Japanese, with their heavy
howitzers, had levelled to the ground the
whole of his battery.</p>

<p>As soon as the first shot was fired, my
Chinese cook, Moritz, faithlessly left me in
the lurch, and one evening I found that
also Fritz, Max and August had vanished
without trace.</p>

<p>After a few days a new Chinese cook&mdash;Wilhelm&mdash;appeared
on the scene, and recounted
with emphatic gestures:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“Kind Master, me plenty good cook; me
no lun away like bad fellow Molitz; me havee
no fear; me makee plenty good chau-chau.”</p>

<p>I believed him, promised to give him five
dollars and more. Things went fairly well,
until one day the first enemy shells burst
close to my house, and Herr Wilhelm as
promptly disappeared as his predecessors.</p>

<p>I now sat alone in my deserted home
with my faithful batman, Dorsch. We were
the only inhabitants of the whole villa
quarter of Iltis Bay.</p>

<p>Not exactly a safe or pleasant spot, for the
villas were built on the hill which carried
our chief batteries, and the enemy shells
which whizzed past them landed straight
in our midst. But we were very cautious.
That is to say, we left our top floor and
settled down comfortably and safely on
the ground floor. As a further precaution
we placed our beds in a corner, in such a
way that they were far from a window,
and thus we secured sufficient immunity.
It was, however, lucky that no heavy shell
challenged this position.</p>

<p>But I did not remain for long in sole
control of the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>On the forenoon of the 5th of September,
under an overcast sky, with low-hanging
clouds, we suddenly heard the purring of a
motor, and I ran home to see what had
happened. I was hardly there when an immense
biplane shot into sight close over our
heads. I was speechless, and peered dazedly
at the apparition. Soon, however, the first
explosions rent the air, and I now perceived
the round red balls under the planes.</p>

<p>It was a Jap!</p>

<p>I must say that I felt rather queer on
beholding my huge enemy colleague floating
so near us in the sky. A bright outlook
for the future!</p>

<p>Kiao-Chow regarded the advent of the
enemy airman as a most disagreeable surprise,
for no one had expected that the Japs would
be equipped with aircraft.</p>

<p>On the whole, they eventually produced
eight aeroplanes, amongst them four gigantic
seaplanes, for whose possession I heartily
envied the Japs. How often in the ensuing
weeks did I gaze longingly at them, as they
circled round the town, and wish for one!</p>

<p>The Japs flew well and with extraordinary
pluck. It is lucky, however, that their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
bomb-dropping was not on a par with it,
otherwise it would have been a bad look
out for us. The Japanese bombs were
heavy, of recent construction, and most
destructive.</p>

<p>The enemy seaplanes also had a tremendous
advantage over us. They were able to take
off at a great distance, without consideration
of the wind, with as much space for turning
out as they could wish for; and when they
had ascended with the greatest security to
the altitude of 3000 metres they swooped
down upon us, and simply jeered at our
shrapnels and machine-guns.</p>

<p>One of the chief aims of the enemy was to
destroy my hangar. Soon matters became
so unpleasant for my aerodrome that one
fine day I decided that it was time to stop
my enemy colleagues’ little game.</p>

<p>My real shed lay at the northern end of
the ground; it made a splendid target, and
the Japanese knew its location by heart. I
now built unobtrusively a new shed on the
opposite side, close to a mountain slope,
covering it with clods of earth and grass, so
that nothing of it could be noticed from
above. We then proceeded with deep cunning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and malice to the erection of a bogus aeroplane,
with the help of planks, sailing canvas
and tin. From above it looked exactly like
my Taube. And after that, the moment an
enemy aviator was in sight, we played a
little comedy.</p>

<p>On some days the doors of my old shed
were wide open, and my imitation Taube
sprawled in front of it on the beautiful green
grass. On others the shed was closed and
nothing to be seen. Another day my sham
machine sat in a different place, where it
could be spotted at once. Now the enemy
aviators arrived and dropped bombs and
bombs in their endeavours to hit the innocent
bird. Whilst this was going on we sat in the
real aeroplane, well protected by our roof,
holding our sides with laughter as we saw the
bombs seeking their bogus victim.</p>

<p>Once when we had been specially deluged
with them, I picked out a fine splinter from
a Japanese aviation bomb, affixed my
visiting card to it and wrote:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Kindest greetings to the enemy colleagues!
Why do you shy at us with such
hard objects? If you aren’t careful you
will end by hurting us! It isn’t done.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">I took this letter on my next flight and
dropped it in front of the Japanese seaplane
station.</p>

<p>But this was only to announce my
visit.</p>

<p>In the meantime one of our men had
been preparing bombs for me. Simply
marvellous specimens! Huge tin boxes of
4 lb. each, on which could be read in big
letters: “Sietas, Plambeck &amp; Co., best
Java coffee.” They were filled with dynamite,
horseshoe nails and scrap iron, a
lead spar fixed to the bottom and a fuse at
the top. It was exploded by a sharp iron
point which hit the percussion-cap of a
cartridge. All these things seemed pretty
uncanny to me, and I handled them with
the greatest caution&mdash;always happy when I
had done with them. But they never caused
much damage. Once I hit a torpedo boat,
and even then it did not explode; on several
occasions I just missed a convoy. And once
I learned through Japanese reports that I
had dropped a bomb into the midst of a
Japanese marching column and sent thirty
yellow ones to the nether regions!</p>

<p>I soon got over the first pleasant emotion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of bombing. My time was fully occupied
apart from it, and the results did not justify
the time I lost.</p>

<p>I often met my enemy colleagues in the
air. I did not hanker for these meetings,
for I could do little with my slow, laboriously
climbing Taube against the huge biplanes
which carried a crew of three men. Above
all, I dared not forget that my chief object
was reconnoitring, and after that to bring
back my machine to Kiao-Chow in good
condition.</p>

<p>Once I was busily engaged on my observations,
when my aeroplane began to pitch
and toss. I thought this was due to bumps
in the air, caused by the many steep and
rugged mountains of this country which made
flying extraordinarily difficult. Without
even looking up, I went on taking observations,
only grasping the control-lever with
one hand in order to keep the aeroplane
steady.</p>

<p>After my return I was informed, to my
great surprise, that an enemy plane had
flown so closely on top of me that they
thought I should be shot down.</p>

<p>Next time I was more careful. And on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
sighting one of my enemy colleagues I
followed and shot him down with my
Parabellum pistol, after firing thirty times.</p>

<p>A short time afterwards I nearly shared his
fate. I was only at an altitude of 1700 metres,
and in spite of the greatest efforts I could
not get any higher. I was just above the
enemy seaplane station as one of the great
biplanes started. I now carried out my
reconnaissance, thinking to myself: “Well,
he can bestir himself until he gets up as
high as I!”</p>

<p>But after forty minutes, when I looked
on my left over the plane, I saw the enemy
already gaining on me at a distance of only
a few thousand metres. This meant to be
on guard and climb higher. But my Taube
simply refused to budge, and I could not
gain another yard. A quarter of an hour
only elapsed before the other chap had
outdistanced me, and was coming diagonally
across my trail, trying to cut me off from the
road to Kiao-Chow.</p>

<p>It was now a matter for betting who would
first reach Kiao-Chow, but I won the race.
When I returned to my aerodrome I simply
dived down, and no sooner did I reach the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
ground than bombs were bursting all around
us.</p>

<p>It is extraordinary how they sometimes
find their mark!</p>

<p>Strict orders had been given at Kiao-Chow
that everybody should make for cover
as soon as an enemy airman was sighted.
We had only two casualties&mdash;a non-commissioned
officer and a Chinese. And that
was quite marvellous enough. On my aerodrome
I had about one hundred coolies, and
they always sped to safety. One day, however,
a native remained standing in the
middle of the ground, all on his lonesome,
staring at the large bird. Bang! A bomb
hurtled through the air and exploded but a
few paces away. The poor devil was badly
hit. To have really bad luck there is no
easier way than to be on the spot where
shells and other heavy missiles are flying
about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="pch">HURRAH!</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">HOW did things look at Kiao-Chow
in the meantime? The bombardment
from the sea had become a
daily occurrence, and soon the land batteries
added their boom to the hellish discord.
There was no longer any safety apart from
the bomb-proof redoubts and localities.
The firing became heavier and heavier, and
on some days from the sea alone several
hundred 30-centimetre, half-naval shells
were shot into little Kiao-Chow.</p>

<p>On the 14th of October our naval fortifications
of Hu-Chuin-Huk were directly under
fire. The enemy ships were far out at sea,
and after the second volley the little outpost
was submerged beneath a deluge of
heavy shells. Now volley followed volley.
The whole fortifications disappeared from
sight behind the columns of water, flames
and smoke, and the rumbling and crashing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
of the bursting shells set the earth
a-tremble.</p>

<p>As usual, I stood that morning on the
Coast-commander’s look out, about 1000
metres from the fort, and so witnessed this
terrifying spectacle at first hand.</p>

<p>Sometimes the yard-long shell splinters
flew whirring and hissing weirdly over our
heads, without our paying any attention to
them, as we were so engrossed by what we
saw, which was so stupendous that no words
could fittingly describe it.</p>

<p>We thought with deep sorrow of the brave
garrison and of their sure destruction; but
suddenly, in the midst of the heaviest fire,
our old 24-centimetre gun fired one shot, and
our field-glasses were immediately fixed on
the enemy ships.</p>

<p>Suddenly a joyful and triumphant
“Hurrah!” burst from our lips, for one of
our explosive shells had hit the English
warship <i>Triumph</i> plumb in the middle of
her deck. <i>Triumph</i> veered at once and
ran away for all she was worth, and when
our second shell sped after her a little later
it was only able to hit the water about
50 metres from her stern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Triumph</i> steamed away after a few signals,
which she exchanged with the Japanese flagship,
and went off to Yokohama for repairs.</p>

<p>The three Japanese ships continued their
bombardment&mdash;now at a more respectful
distance&mdash;so that it was useless to fire any
longer with our old guns, which could not
travel half as far.</p>

<p>At midday the bombardment ceased at
last, the enemy being justified by that time
in assuming that the fort was destroyed and
all its inmates killed.</p>

<p>The staff of the Coast-commander at once
hurried to Fort Hu-Chuin-Huk; and I also
followed in my motor-car.</p>

<p>Still under the impression of the terrible
spectacle of the bombardment, we were
most surprised on our arrival to see the whole
garrison merrily tearing round, collecting
splinters and admiring the huge craters
which the enemy shells had dug in the
ground.</p>

<p>What luck! Not a man wounded, not
a gun injured, not a hit on the bomb-proof
rooms!</p>

<p>The whole result of the heavy bombardment
amounted to a broken biscuit-tin and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
a soldier’s shirt, which was hanging out to
dry, and was torn to shreds! It was strange
to think that 51-and 30½-centimetre guns
were used to such purpose!</p>

<p>A heavy shell had passed clean through
the thin steel turrets, and lay peacefully
near the gun on the iron plates!</p>

<p>Now we learned the secret of our lucky
hit&mdash;our guns had in reality only a carrying
range of 160-100. But the gunners had
with infinite pains succeeded in raising the
gun several sixteenths of a degree higher,
and so it carried 200 to 300 metres farther.</p>

<p>Having loaded the breech at its highest
angle, the brave gunners and their gallant
Battery-commander, Oberleutnant Hasshagen,
had quietly stuck to their guns under
the heaviest shell-fire, until at last one of
the ships came within hitting distance. And
the best of it was that it hit the right target!
It is a pity that the <i>Triumph</i> ran away so
quickly, otherwise she would not have
escaped her fate on that day. But, for all
that, it overtook her a little later.</p>

<p>What we could not achieve was accomplished
in the spring of 1915 by our friend
Hersing, when he, with his U-boat, sent this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
same <i>Triumph</i> to the bottom of the sea in
the Dardanelles, thus avenging the garrison
of Kiao-Chow. We owe him a debt of gratitude
for this service.</p>

<p>Ties of sincere friendship bound me to the
officers and the garrison of Fort Hu-Chuin-Huk.</p>

<p>I did not really belong to them, for in the
first place my aerodrome lay close to the
fort, and, in the second, they regularly
watched my start, and, above all, my
endeavours to get clear of their guns. And
more than once the men stood ready to
jump into the sea and to save me, for they
thought I was falling into the water with
my machine.</p>

<p>But as often as I was a guest of the
remarkable Commander of the Fort,
Kapitänleutnant Kopp, we painted our
triumphant return to Germany after the
war in the most glowing colours, and had
of course decided that I should march in
with the garrison of Fort Hu-Chuin-Huk.</p>

<p>On the 17th of October, late in the evening,
a group of officers assembled on the Coast-commander’s
stand and waited in breathless
suspense for her commander, Kapitänleutnant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Brunner, to run the blockade with his torpedo-boat
destroyer S.90.</p>

<p>Two evenings before he had been out in a
gallant endeavour to lay mines on the track
of the Japanese ships. To-day he was going
to fulfil his last and most difficult task&mdash;to
break through the line of the enemy torpedo-boat
destroyers and attack one of the enemy
ships. It was a clear night, and there would
be no moon after ten. The time came.
Ten struck, then 10.30&mdash;the tension became
unbearable. Nothing could be seen of
S.90. Suddenly&mdash;it was eleven&mdash;we perceived
a narrow, grey shadow which carefully
moved on the water under the Pearl
Mountains. And soon our sharp sailors’
eyes recognized the shape of the torpedo
boat. “Good luck to your brave men!”
Our hearts accompanied them with our
warmest wishes. The boat disappeared
from our sight, and soon the dangerous
moment was at hand, when they would have
to break through the enemy lines. Our
eyes were glued in fascination on the open
sea, expecting the flashing of the searchlights
and the thunder of the guns at any
moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>But all was silence.</p>

<p>It was midnight. Another half-hour sped
by&mdash;we breathed more easily, for the enemy
was still in ignorance of the coming attack.
By this time our boat must have reached
the bulk of the fleet. The minutes turned
into hours. No one spoke.</p>

<p>Suddenly at 1 a.m., far away towards the
south on the open sea, a huge fire-column, and
then from all sides the lurid, groping fingers
of the searchlights and a distant muttering
and vibrating.</p>

<p>Hurrah! That was the work of S.90.
And already at 1.30 we received the following
wireless:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE LAST DAY</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE siege progressed according to plan.
The Japanese dug themselves in
ever closer; they brought up more
and more heavy guns, and on several
occasions large bodies of Japanese infantry
made night attacks on our infantry positions&mdash;to
be, however, repulsed each time. After
this they subjected the latter and the wire
entanglements in front of them to continuous
fire, which ceased neither by night nor by
day. Our guns, too, were never silent, but
unfortunately we had to go slow on account
of our remaining ammunition. The extraordinary
length of the siege, the never-ceasing
artillery fire, and the terrible tension
under which we lived, began to tell on us.
My own nerves were getting out of hand.</p>

<p>I could no longer force myself to eat, and
sleep had become impossible. When I shut
my eyes at night I immediately saw my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
map, and below me the Protectorate with
its enemy trenches and positions. My head
swam, and my ears ached from the whirl of
the propeller, and I could hear, over and
over again, the words of the Chief of
Staff:</p>

<p>“Never forget, Plüschow, that you are
now of more value to Kiao-Chow than our
daily bread. Don’t fail to return and keep
the machine going! And don’t forget that
our shells are few, and that we use them
according to your indications. Remember
your responsibilities!”</p>

<p>God knows I was in no danger of forgetting
them. I had no other thought but the
enemy positions in my mind, visualizing
time and again the fortifications over
which I had flown, trying to remember
whether I had actually <i>seen</i> what I had
reported, and figuring out whether the few
shells which we still possessed had not been
squandered at my instigation.</p>

<p>When I had racked my brain fruitlessly
for hours I sometimes fell asleep about three
in the morning, tired out in body and soul.
But no sooner had I dropped off than duty
called, and my mechanic stood at my bedside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
to report that my machine was ready
for another flight. This meant prompt
action, and I was soon standing next to my
Taube, testing all her parts.</p>

<p>Sometimes I felt queer and rather jumpy;
but as soon as I was settled in my pilot’s
seat and held the throttle in my hand, after
nodding to my helpers, I had only one
thought, and that was to carry out my task
with iron determination and calmness. And
when I had got over the start, and safely
reached an altitude of a few hundred metres,
I felt quite at ease again.</p>

<p>One circumstance depressed me particularly&mdash;the
absolute loneliness, the eternal
solitude of my flights. If I had only had a
comrade with whom I might have exchanged
occasional signs, it would have helped me
enormously. And another cause for despondency
was the impossibility of any
flights for several days on end, owing to the
rain or to my faulty propeller. And when
I started again I found so many changes in
the enemy’s positions that I very nearly
gave way to despair. What could I do in
the face of this tangle of trenches, zigzags
and new positions? Often the map dropped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
from my nerveless fingers. But this was
not a lasting phase.</p>

<p>I pulled myself together, picked up my
pencil and gazed downwards. And soon I
had no eyes for anything happening round
me&mdash;my entire attention was focused on the
enemy and my notes.</p>

<p>The 27th of October was a fête day for
us. The following telegram was received
from His Majesty the Kaiser:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Both I and the whole German nation look
with pride on the heroes of Kiao-Chow, who
carry out their duty faithful to the word of their
Governor. Rest assured of My gratitude.”</p>

<p class="p1">There was hardly anyone in Kiao-Chow
whose heart did not beat the faster for this
praise. Our supreme War Lord, who had
so much heavy work on hand at home,
did not forget his faithful little band in the
Far East. Each of us swore to do his duty
to the end, in order to please his Kaiser.</p>

<p>Soon the 31st of October&mdash;the Mikado’s
birthday&mdash;was upon us. We had ascertained,
through our scouts, that the Japanese had
fixed on that day for the capture of Kiao-Chow.
It is impossible to describe it.</p>

<p>The Japs had planted all their land-batteries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
in readiness for the night, and at
6 a.m., on the 31st of October 1914, the
bombardment started from land and sea.</p>

<p>Their first hits exploded the petrol tanks,
and a thick, huge column of smoke reared
skywards like an ominous signal of revenge.
The Japanese were shooting from the land
with heavy 20-centimetre shells, and the
ships had trained their heaviest guns on
to us. The whizzing of the descending
howitzer shells, the whistling and the exploding
of the grenades and their detonations
on bursting, the barking of shrapnel,
and the roar of our own guns resulted in a
din as though hell itself had been let loose.</p>

<p>The outworks and the whole surrounding
country were also heavily damaged; hill-tops
were levelled, deep craters opened in
the ground.</p>

<p>By the evening we experienced a slackening
of the enemy’s fire. He was convinced, and
so were we, that all our defences had been
razed, for they looked like a mass of ruins.
But when our gallant lads in blue hurried to
their guns, to dig them out of the mass of
earth and stone, they found nearly all the
batteries comparatively undamaged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly in the dead of night, when we
were able to note the formation of the
storming columns, from every cannon’s
mouth issued a stream of fire, which must
have caused endless casualties to the
Japanese.</p>

<p>There was no attack, as had been planned,
and the next day the enemy artillery
directed a half-hearted bombardment on us.
At the same time it was vigorous enough to
register fifty successful hits on our small
fort of Hu-Chuin-Huk.</p>

<p>The Japanese profited by the experience of
that night. Eight terrible days and nights
followed, for their artillery thundered without
a break.</p>

<p>It might well have been assumed that not
one of us could have escaped this ghastly,
thunderous fire; but, as if by a miracle, we
had very few casualties. The Japanese
artillery shot with great precision, which is
not surprising, as many of their artillery
officers had been trained at our gunnery
school at Juteborg. But their ammunition
was rotten. And that proved our salvation.</p>

<p>They never once succeeded in penetrating
any of our redoubts or bomb-proof localities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
To this, as well as to their blank shooting,
we owe our insignificant losses.</p>

<p>I would like to point out to the cavillers in
Germany, who grumbled that our fight for
Kiao-Chow could not have been serious if
we suffered comparatively so little, that
we held but one single line of defence, composed
of five infantry works, a parapet and
a miserable wire entanglement. This line
was 6000 metres long and held by 3000 men.
We had neither a second line nor a second
position, and, above all, no men to spare for
their defence, for our whole garrison comprised
but 4000 men.</p>

<p>When after a week of heavy continuous
artillery fire our wire entanglements and
parapet had been shot to pieces, it was an
easy job for the 30,000 Japanese&mdash;whom we
had held at bay for weeks&mdash;to rush through
and force the surrender of Kiao-Chow.</p>

<p>In the early days of November we prepared
for the end. On the 1st, our loyal ally, the
Austrian cruiser <i>Kaiserin Elisabeth</i>, was blown
up by her gallant crew after she had fired her
last shot. A few days later she was followed
by our last ship, the brave little gunboat
<i>Jaguar</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Our deck and crane followed, and then
came the turn of our wharves.</p>

<p>We no longer had much help from our
guns. A few were out of action, others had
been destroyed by enemy artillery, the
greater number we blew up ourselves.</p>

<p>On the 5th of November 1914 I myself
was forced to undertake the destruction of
my biplane. I had succeeded, assisted by an
Austrian ex-aviator, Leutnant Clobuczar, in
the construction of a wonderful, large two-seater
hydroplane. It lay in readiness, and
it had been my intention to reconnoitre
with it, as it was no longer possible to use
our aviation field, which was only 4000 to
5000 metres distant, but held under the
steady fire of the enemy.</p>

<p>Nothing was to come of my biplane, and
all our labour was in vain, for that afternoon
our Chief summoned me and said:</p>

<p>“We are expecting the Japanese main
attack at any hour now. See that you leave
the fortress by aeroplane, though I fear the
Japs will give you no time to do so. And
now, God speed you, and may you come
through safely. I thank you for the work
you did for Kiao-Chow!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>He gave me his hand. I said, standing at
attention:</p>

<p>“I report myself obediently as leaving
the fortress!” And with this I was
dismissed.</p>

<p>I took leave of my superior officers and
of my comrades, and was entrusted with a
large bundle of private correspondence.
Then I went back to my villa for the last
time, and said good-bye to my rooms and
to the many objects to which I had become
attached. I opened my stable door, freed
my little horse and my chickens, and went
down to my aeroplane to prepare it for its
last flight. After that I sat poring over my
map, learning it by heart, and making my
calculations.</p>

<p>At night I went up to the hill-top, where
my friend, Oberleutnant Aye, had been holding
out for weeks, with his small battery,
under most severe shell-fire. From there one
had a magnificent view of Kiao-Chow and
its surroundings. I sat for some time on the
highest peak, fascinated by the panorama at
my feet. Below us a sea of fire, with flashes
of lightning from the guns thundering across
space, and like a golden thread stretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
from sea to sea the yellow rifle and machine-gun
fire. Right over my head screamed,
swished and whistled thousands of shells,
sweeping closely over the hill-top, bent on
reaching their targets. Behind me our heavy
howitzers roared their last message, and in
the distance from the farthest southern
point of Kiao-Chow the 29-centimetre guns
of Fort Hstanniwa poured out their swan
song.</p>

<p>Harrowed to the depths of my soul, I
returned to Aye, and after taking a hearty
leave of him, carrying with me all his good
wishes for my venture, I left him, after
shaking him warmly by the hand.</p>

<p>I was the last officer in Kiao-Chau to do so,
for he fell a few hours later in the heroic but
unequal fight against the Japanese, he and
his gallant little band preferring death to
surrender. A truly shining example of noble
heroism.</p>

<p>I spent the remaining hours with my
four brave helpers, waiting in readiness near
my machine so as to be able to carry out
my orders at a moment’s notice should the
Japanese break through.</p>

<p>On the 6th of November 1914, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
early dawn, with the moon still shining, my
aeroplane stood clear for the start, and my
propeller gaily hummed its morning hymn.</p>

<p>There was no more time to lose. The
aviation field had become extremely uncomfortable
through the continuous shell
and shrapnel fire.</p>

<p>Once more I examined my machine,
shook hands with my men, stroked the
head of my faithful dog, then I opened the
throttle and my Taube shot like an arrow
into the night.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as I was just about 30 metres
above the centre of the aerodrome, my
machine received a fearful jar, and I was
only able to prevent her crashing downwards
by putting forth all my strength. An
enemy grenade had just burst, and the air-pressure
caused by the detonation nearly
sent me to the ground. But, thank goodness,
a big hole in my left plane caused by
a shell-splinter was the only damage.</p>

<p>The usual hail of shrapnel followed&mdash;my
last farewells from the Japs and their
English Allies.</p>

<p>When I was high enough I turned round
once more to look at our dear little Kiao-Chow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
which had suffered and was still
to suffer so much. Our beloved second
country&mdash;Paradise on earth.</p>

<p>Two lines of fire, facing each other, were
clearly distinguishable, and the faint roar
of guns could be heard&mdash;sure forerunners of
renewed attack and desperate defence.</p>

<p>Would we be able to ward it off for the
third time? I waved my hand towards
Kiao-Chow! Farewell, my faithful comrades,
fighting down there!</p>

<p>This leave-taking was infinitely bitter,
and I struggled for composure. I flung my
machine round with a swift wrench, and
steered it towards Cape Taschke.</p>

<p>When the sun rose in all its glory, I was
already floating in the blue ether, high over
the wild southern mountain peaks.</p>

<p>I had run the blockade in true modern
fashion.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="pch">IN THE SLIME OF THE CHINESE
RICE-FIELD</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE enemy fleet lay at anchor
behind the Pearl Mountains. I
could not resist the temptation,
and flew round them once again. Then I
wended my way farther and farther towards
South China, an unknown land and an
uncertain fate. I passed over rugged
mountains, over rivers and wide plains,
sometimes crossing the open sea, then again
high above towns and villages.</p>

<p>I guided myself by map and compass, and
at 8 a.m. I had already put 250 kilometres
behind me, and reached my destination&mdash;Hai-Dschou,
in the province of Kiangsu.</p>

<p>I peered into the plain below in search
of a suitable landing-place; but my prospects
were not too promising.</p>

<p>The torrential rains of the past weeks
had turned the ground into a veritable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
swamp. The only dry spots were covered
with houses or Chinese burial-mounds.
Finally I discovered a small field, 200 metres
long and 20 metres wide, which was bounded
by deep ditches and high walls on two sides,
and by the river on the others.</p>

<p>Landing was confoundedly difficult, but
there was no help for it, for I could not stay
up for ever. Besides, I was in China, not
in Germany, and could count myself lucky
to have found this spot at all.</p>

<p>I descended in wide curves. And after a
steep spiral, during which the machine
sagged heavily in consequence of the depression
in the atmosphere, I landed in
the middle of the swampy rice-field at
8.45 a.m.</p>

<p>The clay was so soft and sticky that the
aeroplane sank into the mud and the wheels
were held fast; my machine landed on her
nose, nearly turning turtle at the last
moment. The propeller shivered into fragments,
but luckily I escaped without hurt.</p>

<p>The silence which reigned struck me as
uncanny after the incessant crash and turmoil
of war of the last weeks. My little
Taube rested calmly and peacefully in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
bright sunshine, with her little tail up and
her nose embedded in the mud. I could distinguish
a crowd of Chinese in the distance&mdash;men,
women and swarms of children&mdash;pressing
forward in awed wonder. They,
together with all the other Chinese over
whose land I had flown, could not account
for my presence, for I was the first aviator
they had ever seen, and they were all convinced
that I was an Evil Spirit bent on their
destruction. So when I clambered out of
my machine and tried to signal to them,
there was no holding them. They all fled,
howling and screaming, the men first,
leaving the children who dropped behind
as peace-offerings to the devil. I do not
think my appearance could have caused
greater consternation in darkest Africa.</p>

<p>With prompt decision I ran after them,
hauling three or four of them by their pigtails
to the machine, so as to convince
them that the big bird was harmless.</p>

<p>This helped after a little, and when I
presented them with some gold pieces they
averred that by a lucky chance they were
in the presence of a Good Spirit; therefore,
they willingly helped to place the aeroplane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
in a horizontal position once more. When
the others saw this, they gathered round in
such crowds that I was surprised the machine
was not crushed.</p>

<p>How the Chinese marvelled! How they
touched and examined everything! How
they laughed and chattered!</p>

<p>Only those who know the Chinese and
their childlike disposition can gauge the
amusing situation in which I found myself.</p>

<p>I sat in my pilot’s seat, over the tin box
containing the secret papers, with a Mauser-pistol
close to my hand, surrounded by a
horde of Nature’s children, whom it was impossible
to get rid of, though I repeatedly
made the attempt. The creatures merely
grinned joyously and made fun of me.</p>

<p>I was at last freed from this predicament
by a “Good morning, sir,” boomed into my
ear. A gentleman, who introduced himself
as Dr. Morgan of the American Mission,
stood before me. We greeted each other
warmly, and I informed Dr. Morgan of what
had happened, and asked him to use his
knowledge of the Chinese language, which he
spoke fluently, to help me. I soon saw that
I was in good hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>My huge Chinese passport, which I had
brought with me from Kiao-Chow, was
immediately sent to the Mandarin; an
hour later a detachment of forty soldiers
arrived from the barracks situated a short
distance off, to keep guard over my
machine.</p>

<p>I gladly accepted Dr. Morgan’s invitation
to breakfast, and, laden with all the
movable objects in my aeroplane, I set off
with him to the Mission.</p>

<p>I was welcomed most charmingly, and
made the acquaintance of Mrs. Morgan,
also of Mrs. Rice, the wife of the American
missionary, and of a Mr. G., who all took
the warmest interest in me.</p>

<p>I had just sat down to breakfast when a
Chinese officer appeared, with the announcement
that a guard of honour, consisting of a
company of soldiers, had been placed before
the house, and that he was under orders from
his Mandarin to ascertain my wishes, and
how I was. The Mandarin himself, however,
would call on me in half an hour.</p>

<p>I was delighted at so much courtesy.</p>

<p>After another ten minutes new visitors
arrived; this time the civic authorities of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Hai-Dschou, who desired to greet me in
person.</p>

<p>The situation was unique. I sat in the
midst of these venerable old Chinese, having
exchanged numerous bows and obeisances.
The conversation soon become animated,
Dr. Morgan acting as interpreter.</p>

<p>There was no end to their questions:
Whence did I come? How were things
in Kiao-Chow? Was it really true that
I had come through the air? How long
had I taken for my flight? What magic
had I used to be able to fly? It was
hardly possible to answer all their posers,
and, though our interpreter took infinite
trouble, I am sure that the Sons of Heaven
were not much the wiser.</p>

<p>Soon there was a slight break.</p>

<p>While we sat talking, visitors were announced
for the lady of the house, and ten
or twelve delightful little Chinese women,
swathed in wonderful silken garments and
trousers, tripped past us. Two or three of
them lingered near the door of the room in
which we men were seated, and stared at
us in awed fascination with big, round
eyes and small, half-opened mouths. Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Morgan called to them from the adjoining
room, and they gave a frightened start and
ran away. I only learnt the reason for
their strange conduct later. It seems that
it is a social <i>faux pas</i> for a Chinese woman of
gentle birth to offend a male visitor by her
curious glances.</p>

<p>The three sinners received a severe reprimand.
I must admit I did not care for
this custom, for I should have liked a good
look at the elegant little ladies.</p>

<p>My hostess confided to me that she, too,
had been pestered by questions from her
guests. Above all, they wished to know
who this Evil Spirit was which had threatened
their town, yelling and growling. When
they were informed that it was a mere
man who came from Kiao-Chow, they
laughed and declared that they were not
fools enough to believe <i>that</i>!</p>

<p>Mrs. Morgan assured me laughingly that
everything that might happen to go wrong
in the next two years, such as bad harvests,
miscarriages, mishaps of any description,
would be put down to my account,
and prove of invaluable service to the
Medicine-Men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>The Mandarin arrived about eleven, preceded
by an uproar of tom-toms, drums
and whistles. He advanced with great
dignity, an imposing figure of rotund proportions,
with a carefully shaven head, clad
in magnificent silken garments. Our salutations
were extremely formal, and the deep
bows to the ground seemed endless.</p>

<p>The Mandarin inquired thoughtfully after
my health and wishes, and assured me of his
aid and protection. He took leave with the
same ceremony.</p>

<p>As soon as I had returned this official
visit, and had been invited to sup with the
Mandarin, I proceeded to dismantle my
aeroplane.</p>

<p>But this was more easily said than done.
I only possessed a spanner, and had now to
hunt for tools. Moreover, I was in China,
and in a part of the country where the last
thousand years had brought no changes.
Wrenches or screw-drivers were unknown
quantities.</p>

<p>At length I discovered an axe in the
American Mission, and a miserable object
that looked like a saw.</p>

<p>I set to work with these implements, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
as I wished at least to save my faithful
100-h.p. Mercédès motor from destruction, I
sawed and hacked it away from the body.
Proof enough of the thoroughness of German
handiwork, for it took me fully four hours
to detach it.</p>

<p>In order to conform to Neutral Laws,
I handed over the motor to the Mandarin
for safe keeping.</p>

<p>Then came the saddest part. As the rest
of my machine, even minus planes, could
pass through none of the streets or gates of
the town, I had to surrender it to the flames.
I poured petrol over it, set it alight, and saw
it turn to ashes before my eyes.</p>

<p>And as I stood by, watching the holocaust
of my poor, brave Taube, I felt as if I were
losing a dear and faithful friend.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="pch">MR. MACGARVIN’S PTOMAINE POISONING</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">IN the evening the Mandarin held his
reception.</p>

<p class="pn">When I stepped out of my door the
whole courtyard was ablaze with torches
and countless large Chinese lanterns. The
guard presented arms, the drums beat and
the musicians gave us some tunes&mdash;hardly
pleasing except to Chinese ears. The Mandarin
had even sent me his own palanquin.</p>

<p>I shall never forget that evening. I sat
in a litter upholstered in blue silk, with
curtained windows, which was carried by
eight sturdy fellows. In front, on the sides
and behind the palanquin, marched soldiers
with fixed bayonets and dozens of runners
with paper lanterns. The palanquin swayed
gently to the tread of the bearers. Every
ten minutes the man at the head gave
a loud signal by rapping with his stick on
the ground; the litter halted, the bearers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
moved the carrying poles to the other
shoulder, and on we went like the wind.</p>

<p>After forty minutes we reached the Mandarin’s
palace. Ear-splitting music, shouted
orders and the light of many lanterns and
torches greeted us. The centre doors of the
gigantic portals flew open before me, and in
front of the last one the Mandarin himself
came forward to receive me.</p>

<p>Several high dignitaries and generals had
already assembled, and after ceremonial
greetings the ordinary green, thinnish tea
was handed round as a sign of welcome.
I took advantage of this to present to the
Mandarin my Mauser pistol, plus ammunition,
as a token of my gratitude. He was
visibly pleased, and we sat down to our
meal in high good humour. A huge, round
table, covered with some fifty dishes, in
which swam the daintiest Chinese delicacies,
awaited our pleasure. As a specially
honoured guest I was handed a knife and
fork, and the feast began. I added up
the courses, but lost count at the thirty-sixth!
But what about the menu? From
the delicate swallows’ nests to the finest
sharks’ fins; from sugar-cane salad to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
most perfect chicken stews&mdash;nothing had
been forgotten. I had to sample everything,
and the Mandarin was tireless in his
attentions, and even sometimes lifted a
particular titbit from his own plate to place
it with his own fingers on mine! We drank
bottled beer from Germany! And German
Schnaps.</p>

<p>Mr. Morgan’s was the hardest task, for
he had to interpret the conversation, which
was not devoid of comic aspects.</p>

<p>The battles round Kiao-Chow, the losses
of the Japanese and the English and the
flying interested the Chinese most of all.
Their questions never ran dry.</p>

<p>I took hearty and grateful leave of my
Mandarin, and the next day I did the same
of my amiable hosts.</p>

<p>When I landed with my aeroplane I had
only a tooth-brush, a piece of soap and my
flying-kit, <i>i.e.</i> my leather jacket, a scarf
and leggings. I had also taken a civilian
suit with me. I now donned the latter.
The five-year-old daughter of our missionary
presented me with her old, shabby little felt
hat to replace my sports cap, which a
Chinese had stolen whilst I was dismantling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
my machine. And in the evening I was
again conducted with ceremony to the junk,
which was placed at my disposal.</p>

<p>My suite, and at the same time guard of
honour, during the coming journey consisted
of the Chinese General Lin, well
known as a fighter of pirates, of two
officers and forty-five men, apart from the
crew of the boat. I was terribly worn out
after all I had been through, and went to my
small wooden room, where to my joy and
surprise, instead of the plank-bed, I found
a beautiful sleeping-bag with mattress and
blankets, which the attentive wife of the
missionary had sent on board for me. Without
these I should have come off badly in
my thin sports clothes. It was bitterly
cold, the wind whistled through the gaps
and crannies, and I could see the starry
sky through the awning. And whilst my
thoughts lingered with my brave comrades in
Kiao-Chow, and I gratefully recalled the
many battles and dangers I had come
through in order to fulfil my task to the
end, sleep overtook me and enfolded me in
its arms.</p>

<p>The journey proceeded by slow stages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
The junks were dragged upstream by two
coolies, by means of a rope which was
fastened to our masthead. It took us a day
and a half to cover the first stage to Bampu,
which I had flown in twenty minutes with
my aeroplane. Later on we went faster,
especially with a favourable wind filling our
sails. But it was only five days later that
we arrived at Nanking.</p>

<p>Our progress interested me immensely,
for we traversed a criss-cross of rivers to the
famous Emperor’s Channel, and through
this we reached Nanking by way of the Yangtse-kiang.
The country was famous for its
pirates, and we passed towns where no
European had set foot. During the day,
whilst the junk was being towed along, I
walked on the bank with the General and
some of our guards, and watched with great
interest the active and crowded life of these
cities, as yet untouched by Western civilization.
Chinese men, women and children
came running out of their houses, stared in
astonishment at the sight of a fair man, with
blue eyes, who wore no hat. And they
sometimes touched my garments to convince
themselves that I was really human.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>My walks and my life on the junk took a
quiet and rather silent course. My courteous
General, though he wore European attire,
had the typically Chinese bands wound
round his ankles, and he sported a fine, long
“tail” which was coquettishly tucked under
the belt of his jacket. The good man knew
not a word of any language but Chinese,
and I knew none of that. During our meals,
which were of the richest description, but
reeked terribly of onions and garlic, we
sat opposite each other, and grinned
amicably at one another&mdash;and that was our
whole conversation.</p>

<p>At last, on the 11th of November, we
arrived at Yang-dchou-fou, and one can
imagine with what avidity I threw myself
on the first newspaper.</p>

<p>Full of excitement in the expectation of
hearing at last about the fate of Kiao-Chow,
I devoured the pages of the <i>Shanghai
Times</i>. There on the second page&mdash;the
name Kiao-Chow. But what was that?
Could such treachery exist in the world?
For with disgust and loathing of the
low English-lying brood, this is what I
read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p class="pc1 mid">“<span class="smcap">The Cowardly Capitulation
of
Kiao-Chow.
The Fortress taken without a Blow.
The Garrison Drunk and Looting.</span>”</p>

<p class="p1">And after that so much mud, such low-down
lying, that I threw the paper aside in
disgust. And this was what the English,
who had behaved with so little valour before
Kiao-Chow, dared assert about our brave
defenders!</p>

<p>Ah, but I did not know the English
papers then! Later in Shanghai, and also
in America, I had to get used to much worse
from the American Press, to say nothing of
the English. But now, at least, I was
certain as to the fate of Kiao-Chow, which
was inevitable from the first. I saw also
how opportunely I had left the fortress,
on the very eve, so to speak, of her forced
surrender. We arrived safely at Nanking
on the 11th of November 1914.</p>

<p>I was warmly welcomed at the station by
Kapitänleutnant Brunner, Commander of the
torpedo boat S.90, and his officers.</p>

<p>We drove in a carriage to the buildings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
which had been allotted to the officers and
crew of the S.90, and where, to my astonishment,
a room was already prepared for me.
When I amazedly inquired the reason of
this, my comrades told me that I was to
be interned, and that they all rejoiced
to have a fourth at Skat. I protested
loudly that I did not play cards; also,
I held my own views on the question
of internment, but these I kept to
myself.</p>

<p>So I repaired with my General Lin to the
palace of the Governor of Nanking. Unfortunately,
or rather luckily, we could not
see the Governor, and an old Chinese doctor
received us very kindly in his stead, and
expressed the hope that I should be very
happy in Nanking.</p>

<p>I thanked him profusely, though I had
no such intention!</p>

<p>I now took leave of my General Lin,
who seemed obviously relieved at having
concluded his mission; but, when I stepped
into my carriage, a fully armed Chinese
soldier followed me.</p>

<p>When, astounded, I asked for an explanation,
he told me in fairly intelligible German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
that he was my “Guard of Honour,” and
had been attached to me for my <i>protection</i>
and would henceforward accompany me
in all my comings and goings.</p>

<p>That was <i>too</i> bad! Had I not been
formally assured in Hai-Dchou that my
removal to Nanking was a pure formality,
and that I should be absolutely free?</p>

<p>So they wanted to intern me?</p>

<p>In that case I had to act promptly,
before I gave the Chinese the chance to
announce this fact to me and rob me of
my freedom. The “Guard of Honour”
was a nuisance, but I hoped to find means
of getting rid of him.</p>

<p>The same evening we were all bidden to
the house of a German friend. I had settled
on my plan. After a few pleasant hours,
during which I had to recount time and
again the last days of Kiao-Chow, the other
officers took their departure at ten o’clock,
followed by their faithful sentries. I stayed
on, but after half an hour decided that it
was imperative for me to depart, if I still
wanted to make my escape.</p>

<p>But when my host stepped out from the
house whom did he see? My yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
guardian! We were in a fix; but with
prompt decision I sent our “boy” to ask
him what he meant by waiting, as all the
gentlemen had been gone for a good while,
and he would be punished for his carelessness
if he did not catch them up.</p>

<p>And whilst the poor devil ran off in their
wake, a closed carriage was taking me to the
station at breakneck speed. I was just
in time to secure the last berth in the newly
run express train. The sleeping-compartment
was already locked, and a tall
Englishman opened the door unwillingly
and with a furious face, in answer to my
spirited knocking. I simply ignored him,
jumped into the upper berth, and, turning
off the light, pretended to undress. In
reality I crept under my pillows and
blankets, resolved not to wake up under
any provocation. But during the next
eight hours I never slept. As often as the
train stopped, I felt cold shivers running
down my back, saying to myself: “Ha,
they will fetch me now!” And, when loud
voices sounded outside, I felt convinced
that my last train-trip during this war was
over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>But nothing happened. The Chinese did
not yet seem to have thought of telegraphing
in connection with arrests, so, according to
schedule, at seven in the morning we arrived
in Shanghai. After successfully passing the
ticket-collector, I promptly bowled along
in a rickshaw through the Chinese quarter&mdash;where
the Chinese authorities still had a
hold on me&mdash;and at last reached the European
side, where I felt safe and free from
interference.</p>

<p>I went straight to a German acquaintance,
who received me with open arms, and whose
guest I remained during the next three
weeks.</p>

<p>For it was fully that before I was able
to continue my journey; and in the meantime
how many adventures, perils, and
games of hide-and-seek!</p>

<p>For what was more natural than that
Oberleutnant P. should not be known at
all at my quarters, and that Herr Meyer,
who had stayed there for a few days, should
already have left?</p>

<p>That Mr. Scott had come on a visit to his
kind friends, of course, was no one’s business.
But prudence was essential, especially as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
I knew a great number of people in Shanghai,
many of whom were English, met
previously in Kiao-Chow before the war.</p>

<p>I assumed four or five different names, and
stayed with different friends in succession.</p>

<p>But the greatest difficulty still lay in
finding ways and means to get to America.
Once I nearly got away on an <i>English</i> ship,
thanks to the introduction which a German
friend procured for me. An English ship-owner
introduced me as a Swiss, who did
not know <i>one</i> word of English. I listened
to the whole conversation, but was able
to suppress my jubilation when I heard
that I was to sail on the steamer <i>Goliath</i>,
bound direct for San Francisco. It was,
alas, of short duration, for the ship had
weighed anchor two hours earlier on account
of the tide&mdash;and we came too late!</p>

<p>I could have tried another steamer, but
they all went by way of Japan, and I feared
to risk that.</p>

<p>Fortune, however, smiled upon me. One
day I accidentally met a friend with whom
I had spent many a gay night in the haunts
of the Far East; he was at once ready to help
me. And after only a few days I held the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
necessary papers, and had received all the
needful instructions. From a Mr. Scott,
Meyer or Brown, I turned suddenly into a
distinguished Englishman, rolling in money,
who bore the beautiful and dignified name
of MacGarvin. This gentleman was representative
of the Singer Sewing Machines
Company, and on his way from Shanghai
to his factories in California.</p>

<p>What was more natural for Mr. MacGarvin
than to travel on one of the first outgoing
American Mail Steamers!</p>

<p>There were only two luxurious state-rooms
aboard this boat. The one was
allotted to an American multi-millionaire,
the other to Oberleutnant Plüschow&mdash;no,
I mean, Mr. MacGarvin. One difficulty
still remained: to escape unobserved from
Shanghai.</p>

<p>But there my friends again came to the
rescue. Three days before the ship sailed
I took official leave, and spread the report
that I no longer felt safe in Shanghai, and
was going to Peking, in order to work there
at the German Legation. At eleven that
night I left in a carriage for the station.
How could I be expected to know that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
coachman turned off a few minutes before,
and drove sharply out of the town in a
southern direction? What did I know about
Shanghai?</p>

<p>After we had rolled along the Wusung
River for nearly two hours, we stopped.
Two men armed with revolvers came up, a
brief countersign was exchanged; with deep
respect and gratitude I kissed a woman’s
slim, white hands which were extended to
me from the interior of the carriage, and it
wheeled round and disappeared. My two
friends took me in their midst, I also drew
my revolver, and we stepped silently into
the waiting junk.</p>

<p>The night was black as pitch, the wind
howled, and the dirty, dark water gurgled
dismally as it flew by, driven by the tide.</p>

<p>The four Chinks bent to their sculls with
the utmost exertion, and after an hour we
reached our destination, which lay many
miles downstream on the opposite shore!</p>

<p>Soundlessly we landed, soundlessly the
junk disappeared; and in the same fashion
we made our way towards a dark building
which stood in the midst of a small garden
near some huge factories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>My eyes were blinded by the glare of many
electric lamps, once the door had been carefully
locked after us.</p>

<p>I soon noticed that we were in comfortable
bachelor’s quarters. The table was spread,
and we courageously attacked the many
delicious dishes. Over this meal we decided
on our tactics.</p>

<p>The apartment belonged to the two young
men who worked during the day at the
factory. The servants were pure Chinese,
which was all to the good.</p>

<p>My visit had to be kept secret in any case,
especially as a disagreeable individual, who
belonged to the “Entente,” also lived on
the premises.</p>

<p>It was our intention to take advantage
of the fear which the Chinese profess for
evil spirits, and especially of their superstition
in regard to mad people. Therefore,
my problem was to act the part of a madman
for three days.</p>

<p>I was given a tiny room, where I was
locked in. The “boy” received detailed
and sharp instructions from his master,
and so I felt secure that I should not be
betrayed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Dash it all! I never thought it would be
so difficult to feign madness. For three
days I remained shut up in this room,
raved and stamped about, sometimes dropping
into a chair and staring stupidly in
front of me.</p>

<p>As soon as the “boy,” who was on guard
outside, noticed these symptoms, he carefully
opened the door and pushed through
his tray with food like greased lightning,
then withdrew his arm, and I could feel
with what relief he turned the key on me
on the outside. When I sometimes burst
out laughing, because I felt in such high
spirits, the poor chap must have thought
I had a fresh attack.</p>

<p>At last, on the evening of the third day,
we left the house silently and cautiously.</p>

<p>A large steamer lay near the landing-place,
we took brief but warm leave of each
other, and off we went in the direction of
the Wusung Roadstead.</p>

<p>The weather was bad, the sea rough and
the gangway was not even let down. After
calling and yelling loudly, at last somebody
appeared and helped Mr. MacGarvin to
board the ship with his solitary trunk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Nobody even looked at me. The deck
was in half-darkness, and at last I went up
to several of the officers and inquired as to
the whereabouts of my cabin. Something
unintelligible was growled at me, but when
the gentlemen looked more closely at my
ticket a sudden change took place. Bowings
and scrapings and fluent excuses. A blast
from the whistle of an officer, and several
stewards appeared as by magic, headed by
the white head-steward. The deck-lamps
gleamed. The stewards fought over the
possession of my trunk, and the head-steward
conducted me with <i>empressement</i>
to my state-room. He simply exuded
politeness.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. MacGarvin, why do you come
to-day? The steamer only leaves the day
after to-morrow, and it was known all over
Shanghai at midday!”</p>

<p>I looked furious, and expressed my indignation
that the owner of a state-cabin should
not have been warned in time.</p>

<p>He was followed by my fat Chinese cabin-steward,
who was repose and distinction
personified. But he put me into a fix.
One of his “boys” was ordered to bring my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
trunk, whereupon he asked me, in doubting
tones, whether this represented all my
luggage.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said.</p>

<p>He supposed my other trunks were in
the hold.</p>

<p>“Of course. My heavy luggage was
brought on board yesterday, and I hope
that my valuable belongings were carefully
handled.”</p>

<p>Oh, if the good Chink had guessed how
proud I was of that <i>one</i> trunk, even though
it was suspiciously light!</p>

<p>At last, on the 5th of December 1914, the
steamer <i>Mongolia</i> weighed anchor.</p>

<p>In spite of the lovely weather and good
food, on the very next day Mr. MacGarvin
was suddenly taken ill. He himself did
know what it was. Probably severe
ptomaine poisoning, and the ship’s doctor
was quickly sent for. He was a brilliant
man, a thorough sportsman and ready for
any joke. His concerned face took on an
astonished expression when, instead of a
patient at death’s door, he beheld my
florid and sunburnt countenance.</p>

<p>I had confidence in him, and in a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
words I explained my situation. I have
seldom seen anyone’s eyes gleam with such
pleasure as his did after I had confessed
my sins to him. His uproarious laugh and
warm handshake convinced me that I had
chanced on the right man. The steward
knocked at the door.</p>

<p>The ship’s surgeon assumed an anxious
mien, whilst I groaned. The steward flitted
in, and the American said to him in hushed,
impressive tones: “Look here, Boy! This
Master plenty ill, don’t disturb him, can’t
get up before ten days; give him plenty
good food, chosen by cook; always bring
to him in bed. If Master want anything,
you call me!”</p>

<p>During this speech I already held one
end of the blanket in my mouth, and if
it had lasted longer I would have swallowed
the whole. Once more I took the centre
of the stage.</p>

<p>Three days on the sea, and then came the
first of the three Japanese harbours which
I dreaded. The steamer ran peacefully into
Nagasaki, and immediately a flood of
custom-officers, policemen and detectives
inundated the boat. The bell rang through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the ship, and summoned passengers and
crew for examination. And now the whole
procedure started. The passengers were
assembled in the saloon. Each was called
by name; man, woman and child questioned
by a commission consisting of police-officers
and detectives; their papers closely examined;
and they themselves overhauled
by the Japanese doctor with regard to
infectious diseases. Above all, they wanted
to know which of them came from Kiao-Chow.
The thirty-fifth name called was
that of MacGarvin. Every one looked round,
for, of course, no one had even seen him.
Whereupon the ship’s surgeon approached,
looked very serious, and whispered some
dreadful news into the ear of his Japanese
colleague.</p>

<p>Some fifteen minutes later I heard a hum
of many voices before my cabin. The door
was carefully opened. In walked the
American ship’s surgeon, and in his wake
crept two Japanese police-officers and the
Japanese doctor. The poor victim of
ptomaine poisoning lay in a huddled heap,
moaning softly, and with nothing to be seen
of him but a crop of hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>The American came close to the bed and
lightly touched my shoulder, which apparently
called forth horrible pain. He
immediately stepped back and whispered:
“Oh, very ill, very ill!” The Japs, who
had from the first contemplated the beautifully
furnished cabin with shy admiration,
seemed happy to get out of these unwonted
surroundings. They kow-towed profoundly,
hissed something through their teeth, which
was meant to express particular deference,
a softly murmured “Oh, I beg your pardon!”
and the entire Yellow Peril disappeared
from my sight.</p>

<p>I believe that during this whole scene,
and just before, I did feel a slight attack
of the shivers&mdash;but it did not last.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I risked getting up for a
moment as I wanted to catch a glimpse of
Nagasaki, which I already knew.</p>

<p>But the sight that met my eyes sent me
scuttling back to my bunk. The harbour
was filled with countless steamers, richly
festooned with flags. Extraordinary animation
reigned aboard the ships; troops, horses
and guns were being put ashore continuously.
The soldiers were in gala attire, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
houses of the town nearly disappeared under
the load of garlands and flags; a huge
crowd flowed through the streets to the
parade-ground, where a review was to be
held. So these were the conquerors of
Kiao-Chow!</p>

<p>The whole of Japan fêted to-day the defeat
and humiliation of the German Empire. I
read that night in the Japanese papers,
which appeared in English, that Japan had
achieved that which the English, French
and Russians had tried in vain&mdash;to defeat
Germany; and that from now onwards their
army was the best and the strongest in the
whole world. But enough of this, the
Americans and the English have not shown
greater restraint on other occasions.</p>

<p>Twice more the steamer ran into harbour
during the next days. Both at Kobe and
Yokohama my cabin witnessed the same
procedure as at Nagasaki&mdash;Mr. MacGarvin
remained ill and unmolested.</p>

<p>We stayed five days in all in Japan. At
last, after I had kept to my bunk for a whole
week, we left those dangerous shores. And
when they disappeared on the horizon a
young man on the steamer is said to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
danced with joy and frantically waved a
small hat, which had belonged to a little girl
in far-away China, shouting laughingly:
“Good-bye, Japs! Good-bye, Japs!”</p>

<p>The days passed pleasantly enough amidst
the recreations which are usual on board
an ocean-going steamer. I met several
Germans, whom the war had thrust forth
from their adopted country; also a brother
officer who had been lately busy at Shanghai,
and a war-comrade; the American war
correspondent, Mr. Brace, who was the only
foreigner to take part in the whole siege of
Kiao-Chow.</p>

<p>Neptune took care to provide us with a
change. Shortly before Honolulu, we were
caught in a typhoon, which lasted nearly
two days and threatened our ship with
dire peril.</p>

<p>When we arrived in Honolulu the sun was
shining brightly, and I had to look twice
before I dared trust my eyes. For did I
not see the German war flag!</p>

<p>And as we dropped anchor there lay
alongside, like a tiny cockleshell, the small
cruiser <i>Geier</i>, which, coming from the
South Seas, had run the blockade and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
just been interned. What a curious meeting!
I met dear comrades again from whom I
had heard nothing for a long time, in the
midst of war, far from our country, after
momentous happenings. We talked and
talked without end.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the war the <i>Geier</i> lay
far away to the south amongst the coral-reefs.
She only heard of the Russian mobilization,
then her wireless went to pieces, and she
swam about without news in the Pacific.
Only fourteen days later, the <i>Geier</i> heard
something of the war with England and
later with Japan. This meant caution.
Surrounded and hunted by a score of enemies,
the small cruiser achieved a voyage of many
thousands of sea miles to Honolulu, either
taken in tow by a small steamer or sailing
on her own. And when the huge Japanese
cruiser, which lay on the watch for her at
the mouth of the harbour, one fine morning
beheld the cockleshell safe in port, with
the German flag flying at the masthead, the
yellow monkey had to slink off homewards
with its tail between its legs.</p>

<p>After our departure from Honolulu I had
a bone to pick with my war correspondent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Beaming with joy, he brought me the <i>Honolulu
Times</i> and proudly showed me the first
page, on which my name, my profession and
my nationality were recorded in immense
letters, followed by several columns of close
print, which recounted all my misdeeds
during and after the siege of Kiao-Chow.</p>

<p>Truly American this&mdash;to be judged
according to what the papers said.</p>

<p>But the whole business was extremely
painful to me, for I had every reason to fear
that the American authorities would arrest
me on my arrival at San Francisco on the
strength of this report. However, all the
Americans on board reassured me and
expressed their opinion that I would be
allowed to go my own way without hindrance.
For what I had done was “good sport.”
On the contrary, people in America would
be delighted at my adventures, and if I
only behaved sensibly, and gave up my
foolish German militarist ideas, I could make
a lot of money there. The thing for me to
do was to apply to the right kind of newspaper.
It would take the matter in hand,
arrange for the needful publicity, and then
I could travel from town to town&mdash;possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
preceded by a band&mdash;and collect “plenty
dollars.” Those Americans were truly gifted
with fine feelings! One of these gentlemen,
a jolly old man, who had a charming daughter
with him, came to me one day and took me
seriously in hand.</p>

<p>“Now look here, Mr. MacGarvin, I like
you; I take an interest in your career.
What are you going to do now? You have
probably no money. You are unknown in
America, and it is difficult to find a job
there!”</p>

<p>“Well, I want to return to Germany
and fight for my country, as I am an
officer.”</p>

<p>He smiled with pity.</p>

<p>“You will never be able to get out of
America. And with all respect for your
confidence in your country and your enthusiasm&mdash;believe
me, I have good connections
over there&mdash;in a few months
Germany will be annihilated, and then you
will neither get work nor be allowed to live
there. England will allow no German
officer to remain in Germany when the war
is over. They will all be deported. The
German Empire will be divided, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Kaiser deposed by his own people. Do be
sensible; try to make a new home for yourself
and stay in America. I am quite ready
to help you.”</p>

<p>But that was too much. My patience was
exhausted, and I gave the gentleman an
answer which taught him many new things
about German officers and the real state
of affairs in Germany. In the end he was
quite converted to my ideas, and showed
himself still more amiable towards me.
Subsequently I was often his guest in San
Francisco and New York.</p>

<p>On the 30th of December we cast anchor
in San Francisco.</p>

<p>A typically American reception.</p>

<p>Dozens of newspaper reporters and photographers
swarmed over the deck, filled the
saloons, and even invaded the cabins. The
fellows had already got on my scent. They
surrounded one on all sides; cameras clicked
everywhere&mdash;it was simply revolting. At
last I took refuge in the only expedient
that is of any use. I became rude and
shouted: “I have nothing to say, and if
you molest me any further I shall fetch the
police.” My war correspondent from Kiao-Chow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
had taught me beforehand to treat
his colleagues in this manner.</p>

<p>Only a tiny yellow Japanese crept up to
me like a cat, made a deep obeisance, hissed
through his teeth and said, with a false
smile, that he came from the Japanese
Consulate (of all places!) to greet me and to
wish me happiness on my leaving Kiao-Chow
with such luck. He assured me I had
nothing to fear, as I was on American soil;
but that he would be only too charmed to
send a short account to his paper in Tokio,
to delight his Japanese brethren.</p>

<p>I ordered my Chinese steward to throw
the yellow Jap out.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="pch">CAUGHT!</p>


<p class="drop-cap07">SAN FRANCISCO! Oh, huge, marvellous
city!</p>

<p class="pn">What I enjoyed most was my
freedom from arrest. Officialdom did not
take the slightest notice of my presence,
and I remained there for several days, in
spite of the frantic anxiety of the German
Consulate, which expected me to be led
into captivity at any moment. I have
rarely in my life enjoyed a madder, more
delirious New Year’s Eve than in San
Francisco! Nothing that I had heard about
it approached reality. It was a pleasure to
look at the people&mdash;thoroughbred, every one
of them. The men tall and strong, the
women captivatingly beautiful in their
blonde fairness. My friends invited me
to one of their biggest and most beautiful
night clubs. Exorbitant prices and
the smartest society of San Francisco.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
During that night everything seemed permissible.</p>

<p>The music and the dancing carried one
away with their beauty and wildness. It
was the night of San Francisco.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of January 1915 I took my
departure, and by chance I met in the same
railway carriage one of my comrades, and
also several Germans with whom I had
previously travelled by boat. We had a
most enjoyable journey, the more so as the
papers brought good news from Germany.
As several of the elderly ladies and gentlemen
were bound for home, we two officers
also firmly believed that we were not far
from attaining our object.</p>

<p>We stopped at the Great Cañon of Arizona
to admire the mighty wonders of Nature,
which enfolded themselves in their glorious
beauty. On the following days our train
sped through the prairie, recalling to our
minds boyish recollections of Fenimore
Cooper and the Mohicans. At Chicago
we separated, and I travelled thence to
Virginia on a visit to dear friends of mine,
and in the hope of finding out how I best
could reach Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>After two or three days I sped to New
York to try my luck there.</p>

<p>I had to hang about in New York for fully
three weeks, and during these I had many
opportunities of studying its people and
their customs. Three weeks, in which time
after time I nearly burst with fury. It was
the climax of all I had endured until then.
Hardly a picture, hardly a newspaper, hardly
an advertisement that did not incite hatred
against Germany, that did not pour abuse
on the brave German soldiers. “Tipperary”
seemed to have become the National
Anthem of New York.</p>

<p>Was there no one who could open the
eyes of these people? Did they really
not <i>wish</i> to see and hear the truth? But
the majority knew Germany only from
hearsay&mdash;they hardly even knew where Germany
was; and in spite of this they were
ready with their judgment. Here one could
gauge the monstrous power of the lying
English Press, and the crass stupidity with
which the Americans swallowed the bait.
I did what I could. I talked, and explained,
and tried to convince, but met everywhere
the same answer: “Of course, <i>you</i> would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
not commit these atrocities; but your
countrymen, Huns and Barbarians, do
nothing else. Here it is, black on white
in the <i>Times</i>&mdash;a paper of that importance
does not tell lies.” My greatest consolation
during that time was the touching manner
in which I was treated and received by
my friends and their acquaintances, and I
remain truly grateful to them. One night
I was particularly enraged. I had been to
the Metropolitan Opera House, where I had
listened to one act from <i>Hänsel und Gretel</i>&mdash;German
music, German words and German
songs! My heart was bursting with frantic,
aching longing for my beloved country; my
soul drank in long draughts of German
melody. Still bemused and carried away
by my feelings, I stepped into the street
and found myself at once recalled to reality.</p>

<p>The big space in front of the theatre held
a huge crowd, as it did every night, and a
cinema projector threw the newest war
bulletins in garish letters across a blank wall.
As was to be expected, Russia had again
achieved one of her famous victories. The
English had annihilated the army of the
Crown Prince! The crowd was yelling with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
delight. Battle pictures followed. First
some English and French warships, then
suddenly, the German cruiser <i>Goeben</i>. The
people raved, whistled, hissed, shouted&mdash;the
din was endless. So much for the <i>neutral</i>
Americans, so anxious to uphold the rights
of men and the ends of Justice!</p>

<p>Until now all my efforts to reach Europe
had been fruitless. I had imagined that
my task would be easier. Once I nearly
succeeded in sailing on a Norwegian boat
as an ordinary sailor; but was dissuaded,
as there were several Englishmen in her
crew. At last I got what I wanted. By
chance I made the acquaintance of a man
who had led a rather stormy existence.
He had been all over the world, and had
lived for a long time in New York. I was
never really quite able to ascertain his real
occupation. However, he was very successful
at one particular job&mdash;which consisted
in polishing up old passports. We quickly
concluded our bargain. In a few hours I
had my papers with my photograph neatly
pasted in, and all the proper police notifications
entered according to existing regulations.
And in this wise the Swiss traveller,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
locksmith, Ernst Suse, went on board the
neutral Italian steamboat <i>Duca degli Abruzzi</i>
on the 30th of January 1915, and disappeared
into the steerage.</p>

<p>Two hours later we passed the statue
of Liberty. Five sea miles out of New
York two English cruisers were watching
the mouth of the harbour. A shining
example of the Freedom of the Seas! The
journey was abominable. Though I had
been trained in a rough school as a naval
officer aboard a T.B.D. I had never
dreamed of anything like it. The ship was
heavily overweighted, and pitched and tossed
to such a degree that I was convinced that
she would capsize under the impact of the
heavy seas. And the bugs! But I shall
go into that later. On the morning of the
third day of our journey I stood on deck
and gazed longingly at the first-class railings
over which two charming little faces were
looking down at me. A gentleman approached
them, and with difficulty I suppressed
the name which sprang to my lips.
For I knew him; it was&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Doubt was impossible. It was my brother
officer T., who had come with me from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Shanghai. He saw me at the same moment,
but only recognized me after he had exchanged
some very loud remarks with the ladies about
the filthy fellow down below (meaning myself).
Suddenly he stopped, stared hard
at me, smiled knowingly, after which he
suddenly turned away and disappeared.</p>

<p>In the evening, when darkness had completely
fallen, I had an opportunity of a
short talk with him. He was travelling
as a distinguished Dutchman (of course he
did not speak a single word of Dutch), and
his destination, like mine, was Naples, and
from thence homewards. Though we had
both met daily in New York, each intent on
getting home, we had been obliged by our
respective helpers to keep what we did a dead
secret from each other. And we now learned
that we had both been to the same man!</p>

<p>Some days after leaving New York I
suddenly went down with a high temperature,
and had to take to my bed. I did not know
what was the matter with me, but presumed
malaria, and so did the Italian doctor, who
gave me a ridiculously large dose of quinine.
I did not have to wait long for the result,
as I promptly grew worse, and my temperature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
rose to 103°. These days were indescribable.
Our cabin, a veritable hole,
was shared by four passengers. Above me
lay a Frenchman who only stopped gabbling
and cursing when he was sea-sick. The
lower berth was occupied by a pale and
resigned Swiss (his nationality at once awoke
my suspicions). This man was so sea-sick
that it was my opinion he would never
reach Europe alive. In the upper, left-hand
berth a perfectly rabid Englishman
smoked his pipe of Player’s Navy Cut
unremittingly day and night, in spite of the
closed portholes. He was nearly always
drunk and unable to cease his abuse and
revilings against Germany for one moment.
It is easy to imagine how much rest I got!
To cap it all, my berth lay close to the
engines, and the bugs were the worst item
of the programme. And these dreadful
pests did not come singly, but in battalions.
Oh, what were the noises, the horrible
smells and the sea-sickness compared to
this plague! In spite of my exhausting
weakness I tried to destroy or to drive
away the loathsome insects. But I was
soon forced to give up in despair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>After that I relapsed into complete indifference.
I told myself that the voyage
would be over in a few days, and as soon
as we had reached beautiful Italy, and I
had given myself a short rest, I should be
back in my beloved Fatherland. I fought
off my illness with the utmost energy, and
the thought of Germany aided my convalescence,
so that when the ship reached
Gibraltar on the 8th of February I was
able to be up and about.</p>

<p>Gibraltar!</p>

<p>How many times already had I sailed
past this Rock, how often had I, returning
from foreign parts, tendered joyous
welcome to the grey stones, the sign-post,
in these straits to the faithful homeland!
What was in store for me this time? In
spite of the fact that the time-table made
no provision for calling at Gibraltar, the
ship entered the port for examination, without
even awaiting a request to do so, and
dropped anchor. To this extent had the
Italians already become the slaves of the
English! As soon as the ship lay to, two
pinnaces descended upon us, from which
emerged an English naval officer and sundry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
policemen and sailors armed to the teeth.
A bell was sounded all over the ship, with the
order that all foreign passengers, who were
neither English nor Italian, should assemble
on the pilot bridge. The Italian stewards
went below, inspected the ship’s hold and
all the cabins, and drove us like a herd of
sheep to the upper deck, where we were
closely surrounded by them and the English
sailors. I cannot pretend that I felt particularly
happy! In spite of this I experienced
a certain amount of confidence, as I
soon found out that I was the only one
equipped with a genuine passport and photograph.
On the other hand, I established
the fact that we were five Swiss, three of
whom had already excited my suspicion
on account of their shy and retiring disposition.
There was only one whom I had
not noticed at all, and he looked so dirty
and repulsive that I took the precaution
of moving away when he placed himself
beside me. After an hour, during which
the first-class passengers were examined&mdash;casually,
and with great politeness&mdash;our
turn came. We stood there like six miserable
sinners. The first one was an Italian-Swiss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
workman, who had lost his right arm.
His wife, a typical Italian, prostrated herself
wailingly at the Englishman’s feet.
She was accompanied from the steerage
by her whole tribe, and they <i>all</i> wailed.
The Englishman looked contemptuously at
those people, and after a short examination
the man was dismissed and free to go.
We had now to advance. The tallest
amongst us Swiss stood on the right wing.
The English officer went up to him and said:
“You are a German officer.” Violent and
indignant protestations naturally followed;
but the English officer, whom they left
quite cool, ordered him aside and turned
to us&mdash;we seemed more like the genuine
article in his sight. We pointed to our
passports, and each one of us dished up a
wondrous yarn. After a short pause he
said: “All right; these four can go, but
I will keep that one.”</p>

<p>My heart was throbbing with joy, but, alas,
then appeared the Judas. A young fellow, in
perfectly fitting civilian clothes, went up to the
officer and spoke to him in raised tones. “It
is quite out of the question that these people
should be allowed to leave without having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
all their belongings thoroughly searched.
I am convinced they are Germans.” We
exclaimed loudly at this, but to no end,
though the English officer obeyed this blackguard
with evident reluctance and contempt.
However, the examination took
place. Everything was turned upside down.
The rascal ferreted about everywhere, but
seemed unable to find any incriminating
marks on any of our belongings. Suddenly
he whipped round, tore open my coat,
turned out my breast-pockets and said
triumphantly to the officer who stood at
his side, “You see, there is neither a name
nor a monogram. It is a sure sign that he
is a German, and that he has destroyed all
initials.” Oh, if I could but have brained
the reptile!</p>

<p>As we were soon to learn, this civilian
was the representative of the firm of Thomas
Cook Brothers in Gibraltar, and acted on
the ships in the dual capacity of d&mdash;&mdash; spy
and interpreter. His German was so pure
that he must have enjoyed our hospitality
in Germany for many years. How many
wretched creatures probably owe their undoing
to this busybody!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Once more we five were driven on deck
like cattle. At this moment Judas number
two appeared, who had been fetched by
Cook’s agent. This was a first-class Swiss
passenger, and at the instigation of the arch-sneak
he was to try us in Swiss dialect. Of
course we all failed miserably. Our protests
were useless. Not even when I told them
the wildest tales about knowing no German,
as I had left Switzerland with my parents
when a child of three, and had settled with
them in Italy, and that after that I had
drifted to America. I talked nineteen to the
dozen in good Italian and American, and
I nearly succeeded; but the snake hissed
again&mdash;and my hopes were dashed to the
ground.</p>

<p>The English officer refused us any further
hearing; but only remarked that more Swiss
had passed through Gibraltar than there
were in the whole world. Bursting with a
frenzy that bordered on madness, I was led
away. I quickly gathered my few traps
and was able unobserved to slip a scrap of
paper into a German lady’s hand, which she
later faithfully delivered to my relatives.
A sailor rudely propelled me down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
gangway into the pinnace, where the other
poor wretches already sat, completely crushed.
On the arrival of the English officer with his
minion we started.</p>

<p>The Swiss traitor stood at the breast-rail
of the ship and grinned gloatingly at us.
Thereupon I was unable to contain myself
any longer, but jumped up and shook my
fist at him, yelling out an invective.
Hysterical, treacherous laughter sounded
back.</p>

<p>But a pair of German eyes sent me a sad
farewell from starboard.</p>

<p>Good-bye, oh, happy comrade! Greet for
me the Fatherland you will see again in a
few days.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="pch">BEHIND WALLS AND BARBED WIRE</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE English officer reassured me.
“Be assured,” he said, “that you
will be able to interview your
Swiss Consul at Gibraltar to-day. You will
be free the moment he confirms that your
passport is in order.”</p>

<p>I was only too soon to learn how matters
stood in regard to this. The steam-launch
churned its way through the water, and soon
we disembarked in the inner part of the war
harbour.</p>

<p>Ten soldiers with fixed bayonets stood
ready at the landing-stage. A few curt
orders and, with our few belongings on our
backs, we had to fall in in two files. The
ten soldiers took us into their midst, and
at the word “Quick march” the sad procession
set out on its way. Everything
around me seemed part of a dream. I was
so horribly downcast that I was hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
able to think. A prisoner! Was it true?
Was it possible?</p>

<p>It was horrible, incomprehensible! We
were being led along like malefactors, and
the population seemed to regard us as such.
The soldiers told us to hurry up. I was so
weak that I could hardly move, as the fever
still held me in its grip and I had taken
nothing except quinine for the last three
days. The sun beat down on our backs, and
I had never felt more desolate or more
hopeless.</p>

<p>We climbed higher and higher, through
narrow, hot streets. Soon the houses
gave place to bare rocks on either side.
After an hour we had reached the highest
summit of Gibraltar. Orders rang out,
barbed-wire fences and iron doors opened
and clanged to, chains and bolts rattled.</p>

<p>A prisoner!</p>

<p>We were first brought to the police-station,
and there subjected to an examination. I
protested with energy and demanded to be
taken at once to my Consul, as I had
definitely been promised this by the English
officer. But they laughed regretfully. We
were not the first, alas, that had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
brought before them and had made this
same request! How many had probably
stood in the same place and been obliged
to bury their hopes in the same way!</p>

<p>After that examination we had to submit
to being searched.</p>

<p>“Have any of the prisoners got money?”</p>

<p>Of course no one answered. We were
ordered to undress, and every garment was
closely searched for money, cameras and
especially letters and papers. I came third,
and was allowed to keep my shirt on.</p>

<p>“Have you got any money?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>The sergeant-major passed his hands all
over my body. Suddenly something chinked
in the left-hand pocket of my shirt.</p>

<p>“What is this?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>He now plunged his paw right in, and
what did he extract? A beautiful twenty-dollar
piece of the best American gold, and
also a small mother-of-pearl button, which
had betrayed me by knocking against the
coin. This comes of being too tidy! Had
I thrown it away two days before, instead
of hoarding it carefully, this would not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
happened. The English soldier rejoiced, for
such finds did not occur every day. But
now he examined me more thoroughly.
And to my distress he extracted from my
other breast-pocket, as well as from each of
the two trouser-pockets, a lovely golden
piece and my small Browning revolver,
which had been my faithful companion
all these months.</p>

<p>When I had been completely despoiled
I was allowed to dress again and to rejoin
my comrades in misfortune in the prison
yard. After that we took possession of our
quarters. About fifty German civilian
prisoners greeted us uproariously. They
had been in captivity ever since the beginning
of the war, and seemed to have recovered their
sense of humour. Our new friends invited
us at once to share their meal. We threw
ourselves like savages on the bread pudding
which they had prepared for themselves.</p>

<p>Then we started on our work.</p>

<p>In the first place, we were made to carry
coal and water. We were detailed according
to height, and accidentally I fell in with
the dirty Swiss whom I had already regarded
with such repulsion on the ship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>In the meanwhile we went on dragging
sacks of coal, and we were careful not to fill
the bins to their full capacity. Were we
not too weak to do so properly? After
we had carried on this job for some time
we were allotted our soldiers’ mattresses,
consisting of three parts, and as hard as
stone; also two blankets. We were allowed
to rest that evening. But the first thing
was to get a wash. I well recall the scene.</p>

<p>My filthy colleague placed his basin near
mine, and stripped with the utmost placidity.
Hang it all! I had not expected so much
cleanliness, and inspected him critically. A
perfectly shaped body and clean&mdash;spotlessly
clean! But head, neck and hands! I
shuddered. And then I stopped in the
midst of my ablutions. My eyes opened
wide in astonishment. The water of my
colleague was coal-black; but he was completely
metamorphosed. His black, oily hair
had turned into shining blonde, his face
looked fresh and white, and showed delicate
features, the hands were slim and elegant.
And was it possible? Across the cheek
and the temple ran the honourable scars of
students’ duels&mdash;real German scars! Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
an explosion of joy! Such a cross-fire of
questions and answers! My comrade had
been a <i>real</i> German student, was now at the
head of a good motor-car business in America,
and had left it all to serve his country as
an officer in the Reserve. We chummed up
quickly, and remained faithful, inseparable
friends through all the weeks of our captivity,
until fate separated us once more.</p>

<p>The last post sounded at ten&mdash;lights out
followed.</p>

<p>I had placed my mattress near a French
window, so that I could easily look through
it whilst lying on the floor. The day had
brought many changes, and only now was I
able to reflect on them.</p>

<p>The barracks in which we were quartered
lay at the very top of Gibraltar, on the
south, where the rocks drop straight into
the sea.</p>

<p>Through the window I saw, deep below
me, the wonderfully blue waters of the
Straits of Gibraltar; quite far away on the
horizon, the coast of Africa, a fine and
shining strip of land. Down below was
Liberty, ships wended their way to and
fro, carrying men, free and unfettered, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
could travel where they liked and&mdash;who
did not appreciate how marvellous and
precious it was to be free!</p>

<p>But that way madness lay!</p>

<p>The thoughts and events of the day raced
through my brain, and when I remembered
that, with luck, I might have been on one
of these boats I nearly burst with rage.
And it was my birthday too! Well, I had
planned it otherwise.</p>

<p>Like a madman I rolled about on my
couch. When I thought of how different
things might have been, of all I had hoped
for, and how I had pictured my future, I
gave way to utter despair, and helpless fury
brought the tears coursing down my cheeks
without my being able to check them.</p>

<p>Oh, longing for home&mdash;dreadful longing!
But during that night I was not the only
sufferer.</p>

<p>Pale faces with wide-open eyes stared at
the ceiling, and suppressed sobbing was
smothered in the blankets. The next morning,
at four o’clock, we were suddenly
awakened. The English non-commissioned
officers went through the rooms and yelled
out an order that all German prisoners had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
to get ready to march off in twenty minutes’
time to sail by the next boat to England.</p>

<p>To England! But that was impossible!
Were we not Swiss? Had we not to see our
Consul on that very day? All our efforts
broke against the stolid, imperturbable calm
of the English. We quickly collected our
property and, exactly half an hour later,
the civilian prisoners, numbering fifty-six,
surrounded by a hundred heavily armed
English soldiers, were marched out into the
bright morning.</p>

<p>But we wanted to prove to the English
that our pride was unbroken. With a clear
and ringing sound, intensified by the anger
that was burning within us, we poured
forth “The Watch on the Rhine,” flinging its
notes up to the skies.</p>

<p>A huge transport, filled to overflowing
with English troops, awaited us below. We
had to run the gauntlet through a narrow
passage that was formed for us in the great
crowd of travellers and those who had
come to see them off. But I must admit
that nobody molested us, and that no word
of disparagement reached our ears. Room
for us was made in silence, in silence we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
were allowed to pass, even here and there
we encountered a look of commiseration and
regret. On board, in the front part of the
cargo deck, a space had been partitioned off
and sparsely furnished with benches, tables
and hammocks.</p>

<p>There stood two sentries with fixed
bayonets; there was another couple near
the hatch over our heads. When the latter
was closed down from outside, we sat as in
a trap. The portholes of our habitation
were blinded by iron shutters, so that none
of us should be able to look out or flash
signals. After a short time a slight tremor
ran through the ship, the engines started,
and our swimming prison, rising and sinking
slightly, drifted out into the open sea.</p>

<p>The journey lasted for days. We sat,
closely guarded, shut up in our room. Once
a day we were allowed on deck to get
a breath of fresh air. A most primitive
lavatory had been erected on the fore-deck
with a few boards, and whoever wanted to
use it had to report himself to the sentry.
Only one person at a time was allowed to
appear on deck for this purpose. The food
was good&mdash;real sailors’ rations&mdash;especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the bread, the butter and the abundant
supply of excellent jam. We beguiled the
time away by reading, story-telling; above
all, we discussed our future from all points
of view, and what lay in store for us in
England. The two sentries, who always kept
watch below, soon became quite friendly, and
we often frightened the poor Tommies into
fits by tales of what happened on the Western
Front.</p>

<p>Rough weather greeted us in the Bay of
Biscay. It was a dreadful state of affairs
for the fifty-six of us shut up in that restricted
space, without light or air, and the
majority sea-sick. The sentries, and the
English soldiers who brought us our food,
however, suffered most, and presented a
pitiful spectacle. But when we got into the
Channel the crew was seized with general
nervousness and agitation. Drills with life-belts
were held daily, our recreation-hour on
deck was suspended, and the English soldiers
never stopped questioning us fearfully in
regard to our U-boats! And didn’t we
make it hot for them!</p>

<p>At last, after ten days, we landed at
Plymouth. When the chain cable rattlingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
uncoiled itself, and we knew that we were
safe in port and had escaped U-boats, we
watched through the bulkhead the English
soldiers falling on their knees and singing
hymns of praise and gratitude for their
salvation from the German submarines.</p>

<p>Immediately after our arrival a tender
came alongside and conveyed us to terra
firma&mdash;of course under imposing escort.</p>

<p>The English authorities were evidently
unprepared for such a <i>large</i> consignment of
prisoners. They simply lost their heads.
No one knew what to do with us, no one
what to advise.</p>

<p>At last we were packed into a train. I
got a compartment to myself, flanked on
either side by a non-commissioned officer,
and with another one sitting opposite me,
with fixed bayonets. They had been given
strict injunctions to watch me carefully,
for the following reason: when I saw that
it was quite impossible that I should be set
free or recognized as a Swiss, I had reported
myself to my Commanding Officer in my true
colours, the others doing likewise. He
assured me that he would transfer me at
once to the first class, if I would give him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
my parole never to try to escape or to fight
again in the war. As I naturally rejected this
demand with the utmost indignation, I was
sent back to the cargo-deck, the only result
being a stricter surveillance.</p>

<p>In the evening, at dusk, we reached Portsmouth.
At the station and elsewhere this
huge quantity of prisoners (we were fifty-six
in all) seemed to bewilder everybody
completely.</p>

<p>At last we were marched off to the lock-up.
There also we found great bewilderment
and confusion. The lock-up usually affords
a temporary domicile to drunken soldiers
and sailors who are picked up in the streets,
and who have an opportunity of sleeping off
their intoxication until the next day, when
they are sent back to their platoon after a
sound thrashing [<i>sic</i>]. An old, obnoxious
jailer, and two elderly but jovial and kindly
soldiers, were in charge. We were disposed
of in three rooms. They were totally
empty, and lit by a miserable gas jet. The
window-panes were mostly broken, it was
bitterly cold, and there was, of course, no
fire. We had eaten nothing all day, and
were looking forward to our supper, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
there was no supper. Thereupon we approached
our two old soldiers and promptly
sealed our pact of friendship. A small tip
acted miraculously&mdash;the old fogies simply
scampered off on our errands. We gave
them money, and in half an hour they returned,
groaning under a load of bread,
butter and cold meat. Two huge pots of
tea, mixed with milk and sugar, made their
appearance. We got some charcoal ourselves,
and soon the three fireplaces were
ablaze. The provisions were excellent, and
so abundant that even we, famished as
we were, could not deal with the lot.</p>

<p>Our spirits reached their zenith when the
soldiers slipped us in a few English newspapers.
Our mental hunger had been
greater than our physical needs, as for weeks
we had heard nothing whatsoever about the
happenings of the outer world. We did not
mind reading exclusively of English, French
and Russian victories, as long as we at
least knew something of what was going
on.</p>

<p>Alcohol was forbidden; but even in
England rules seemed made only to be
broken. One of our warders belonged to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
masonic lodge, members of which were
widely distributed over England and
America. My colleague, the locksmith,
happened to be Master. When the soldier
saw the Freemasons’ sign in my friend’s
buttonhole, their pact was sealed. A small
canteen flourished in the basement of our
prison, and one after another we were led
down by the kindly brother, and returned
thence fortified, with pockets bulging with
beer bottles.</p>

<p>The joke was that our sentries, who
stood on guard before our door, allowed us
to go away quietly, and even begged us to
bring them up a few bottles of beer. At
9 p.m. our sentries had become so chummy
that we practised rifle exercises together,
and at 11 p.m. one sentry dropped his rifle
altogether and tumbled backwards, with the
coal-box, on which he had been sitting,
atop of him.</p>

<p>If I had possessed the experience which
was mine after five months’ captivity, I
should have escaped even then.</p>

<p>In this prison, as well as in all other camps
where we foregathered with the English
Tommies, their first request, after we had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
become better acquainted, was for a little
note with our address and possibly the
address of friends in Germany, and an
attestation that the English soldier So-and-so
had treated us well. These notes were
treasured by them as relics, to be produced
at the Front, or in case of capture by the
Germans.</p>

<p>We were given tiny camp palliasses, which
were so short that our legs projected from
the calves downwards, and so narrow that
it would have taken an ingenious circus
performer to balance his back on it. We
also had two blankets each. We slept like
logs, though, it is true, the next morning
found us all on the floor alongside the
mattresses.</p>

<p>On the following morning&mdash;it was Sunday&mdash;we
received the visit of an Army officer
of high rank. He inquired after our wishes.
I pointed out repeatedly that I was an
officer, and had the right to be treated as
a prisoner of war. He was most charming,
and promised me many things when we
should arrive at our destination&mdash;but kept
none of them.</p>

<p>At last, on the Monday, we were allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
to leave our prison. As usual, closely
guarded by our escort, we were marched to
the harbour, where we boarded a small
steamer, and after an hour’s journey reached
a huge ship which was used as a prisoners’
camp. After a long palaver we were
obliged to put out to sea again, for the
Commandant declared that he had no information
about us, and no room either.
Though this comedy was re-enacted on the
next steamer, the Cunard liner <i>Andania</i>, the
fluency of our Major’s vituperations probably
surpassed that of the Camp Commandant’s;
anyway, we went on board after half an
hour’s delay. A fat, bumptious, English
Lieutenant, who filled the post of Camp
Commandant and interpreter on this boat,
received us.</p>

<p>When my turn came to be inspected I
politely presented my request, and forcibly
demanded that, according to regulations, I
should be taken to an officers’ camp. The
answer of this gentleman was quite unprecedented,
and showed up his vulgarity.</p>

<p>“I shall treat you with special severity,
as I have already heard about you. You
bolted from Kiao-Chow, and have several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
times broken your parole. If I hear another
word, I shall lock you up, and will
keep you on short rations until you are
unable to talk at all. Our English officers
are being so badly treated in Germany that
I will make you pay for it.”</p>

<p>It was a happy prospect. What could I
do?</p>

<p>There were more than one thousand
prisoners on board ship. The accommodation
was the most appalling that I have
ever witnessed. Without light or air the
men sat huddled together under hatches,
and their only physical exercise consisted
in running up and down the narrow fore-deck.
When we were led into the room
which had been prepared for us, I was
horror-struck. I think I should have gone
mad had I been obliged to stay there for
long. Our English non-commissioned officer
seemed a sensible man. Through his kind
offices I was able to secure for my friend,
the locksmith, and myself a small cabin
which even boasted of a porthole. Life
on board was very monotonous. We rose
at 6 a.m., and lights went out at 10 p.m.
In the mornings and the afternoons we had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
to stand about for two hours on the upper
deck, and roll-call was at noon. We took
our meals in the huge dining-rooms of the
steamer. Twelve sat at one table, and I had
to take my turn at waiting, fetch the food
from the caboose for the mess, and wash
the dirty crockery with the others.</p>

<p>M&mdash;&mdash;, our Commandant, as a civilian,
had travelled for a whisky firm, and had
made so much money in this capacity
that he was able to buy a commission.
One circumstance had especially enraged
him; as soon as we arrived we were
asked which of us wished to pay 2.50
marks daily, for which consideration we
would be allowed to take our meals separately,
get better food, and be excused from
washing our crockery. Of course we all
saw through this rank swindle, and it made
M&mdash;&mdash; specially mad that we did not
accept. On the second day I finished my
report for the English Government, and
presented myself with it to Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;.
He burst into offensive sniggering.</p>

<p>“You know very well that I will not
pass on your petition, and you can imagine
what I shall do to it. In Germany our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
English Generals are forced to drag ploughs
over the fields; <i>you</i> are going to pay for it.”</p>

<p>It was hopeless to persuade him of the
absurdity of his allegations. Every evening,
when making the rounds at bedtime, he
made a special point of entering my room
as well, turned on the light and said: “Still
here?” Too childish!</p>

<p>One day fifty civilian prisoners were
ordered by Mr. M&mdash;&mdash; to scour the first-class
deck and clean the portholes. Of
course we went on strike. When we persisted
in our refusal we were punished by
being twice deprived of our dinner and
having to go to bed at 9 p.m. Moreover,
M&mdash;&mdash; was such a coward that he did not
dare muster us and order our punishment
himself, but remained at a safe distance and
sent his non-commissioned officer as official
delegate.</p>

<p>M&mdash;&mdash; foamed with rage.</p>

<p>“Of course,” he said, “it is again the
fault of this ‘flying-man’; he is at the root
of the whole trouble, and one of these fine
days he will incite the whole crew to mutiny.
But I will teach him a lesson, and bring
him before a court martial.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>I got fed up with this state of affairs, for
I was totally innocent, so I wrote M&mdash;&mdash;
a very energetic letter, in which I expressed
a hope that he was only a “temporary Lieutenant,”
not a “temporary gentleman.”</p>

<p>M&mdash;&mdash; declared that he would have
nothing further to do with the “flying-man,”
and as early as the next day a steamer
came alongside and took me and some of
my companions in misfortune from the
<i>Andania</i> and its vulgar jailer.</p>

<p>How relieved I felt! The train carried
us westwards for many hours. Of course
I was again alone in my compartment,
accompanied not only by three non-commissioned
officers, but by an officer as
well.</p>

<p>In the evening we reached Dorchester,
where I was greeted by a totally different
atmosphere. An English Captain (whose
name was Mitchell) from the prisoners’ camp
approached me and asked politely whether
I was an officer.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“In this case I am surprised that you
should have been brought to a soldiers’
camp. Please forgive me if I cannot have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
you escorted by an officer. But my senior
sergeant-major will come with you. Will
you kindly walk alone behind the other
prisoners.”</p>

<p>I was speechless.</p>

<p>As we were marching through this delightful,
clean little town, I suddenly heard
“The Watch on the Rhine” being sung
behind us loudly, gaily, and with zest,
followed by the most beautiful soldier songs,
and then “O Germany, high in honours!”
We thought we were dreaming, but when
we looked round with amazement we saw a
troop of about fifty German soldiers who
had been commandeered from the camp to
the station to fetch our luggage.</p>

<p>Oh, how our hearts beat! In the midst
of enemies, in spite of wounds and captivity,
this flaming enthusiasm, this rapturous
singing! I must confess that the English
were extraordinarily tolerant, and the
population always behaved in exemplary
fashion. Silently, closely pressed together,
they stood on both sides of the street.
From all the windows fair little heads
peeped at us, but not one contemptuous
gesture, not one abusive word. They even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
seemed to enjoy listening to the old German
melodies.</p>

<p>In camp thirty civilian prisoners were
allotted a small wooden hut, which combined
our bed, dining and sitting-room. A
tiny palliasse, which lay on the floor, and
two blankets made up our sleeping accommodation.
My Captain begged me to put
up with existing conditions, as he was unfortunately
unable to give me a special room
to myself.</p>

<p>The camp at Dorchester contained 2000
to 3000 prisoners and consisted partly of old
race-horse stables and of wooden barracks.
A hundred years ago German Hussars had
been quartered in these same barracks, on
the occasion of the visit of Field-Marshal
Blücher!</p>

<p>The prisoners were extremely comfortable,
as the food was good and plentiful, the
treatment irreproachable, and there were
many opportunities for sport.</p>

<p>Captain Mitchell and Major Owen especially
deserved praise for the treatment of
our men. Both were true old regulars, had
been through many campaigns and battles,
and knew how to handle troops. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
two and the English Medical Officer presented
the men with games, gymnastic outfits
and a band, and did whatever they
could for them. Special praise is due to the
senior German prisoner, a Warrant Officer,
from Munich. He was a merchant, and spoke
English fluently. A most remarkable personality.
He was really the soul and veritable
guardian angel of the camp. Nothing
was done without his approval and directions.
He was the English Camp Commandant’s
right-hand man, and without
him I do not know what would have become
of the English, who did not possess the
slightest vestige of talent for organization.
It was simply extraordinary how this Warrant
Officer looked after our people and acted as
go-between with the English. The English
officers knew full well what a help he was to
them. By the way, after my arrival in
Dorchester, I had already sent in my petition
to be transferred to an officers’ camp,
for I knew that Mr. M&mdash;&mdash; had kept back
my former one. After a fortnight it was
returned from the War Office with the
remark that the name of some one in England
who knew me must be given. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
most unwelcome; but finally I wrote to my
English acquaintances, and in as soon as
three days I received their answer that they
would willingly vouch for my identity. The
papers again went to the War Office, and I
patiently waited for my transfer.</p>

<p>But time passed, and I still remained at
Dorchester, and when, a fortnight after our
arrival, the other civilian prisoners were
again moved to another destination, I was
able to arrange that I should remain in the
soldiers’ camp at Dorchester. However, I
left my hut and moved into a small room
over the stables, where I was warmly
received by Sergeant-Major N.</p>

<p>Life in this small room was unique and
full of intimate comradeship. My colleagues
were, apart from N., a huge Bavarian
infantry soldier of the Body Guards Regiment,
whose nickname was “Schorsch,” and
who acted as our cook; a nimble and clever
private in the Hussars from Lorraine, a
policeman by profession; and also two
splendid rifle guards of gigantic stature,
genuine blond Frisians. After a week we
received a seventh guest. This was the
sub-lieutenant H., the observer whom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
English had fished out of the North Sea with
his pilot, after they had been drifting about
on the wrecked machine for over forty hours.</p>

<p>The comradeship in this room was ideal.
The men had all been taken prisoners at the
great retreat of the Marne, and, as was
to be expected, these splendid fellows
had only fallen into the enemy’s hands
when severely wounded. They were of such
fine disposition, and showed such burning
love for their country, that my heart filled
with pride and satisfaction. The evenings
were especially pleasant. We contrived a
rough game with a board and some pieces
of cork, and gambled on <i>petits chevaux</i> regularly
every night with childish delight.</p>

<p>But the real fun began when we started
exchanging experiences. Everything was
new to me, and I was happy to learn at last
from first-hand information of our splendid
battle and triumphs.</p>

<p>Every afternoon 300 to 400 prisoners,
of course closely guarded by English soldiers,
were led out for their exercise, which took
them into the lovely open country. I
often accompanied them. All the time our
soldier songs were sung; but with particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
force and ecstasy when we marched through
the town, going and returning, “The Watch
on the Rhine” and “O Germany, high
in honours!” Imagine 300 or 400 of our
picked men, our victorious troops under
General von Kluck! The English population
behaved even then with the utmost
restraint, and never uttered a word of
abuse or a threat. The sergeant-major
told me of a very nice episode. When
Major Owen and Captain Mitchell were
appointed to the camp, their wives implored
them not to go among the “Huns” without
escort and without being heavily armed.
The two old soldiers, however, kept their own
counsel, and were&mdash;not devoured! After
a time they suggested to their wives that
they should visit the camp and convince
themselves that the German soldiers were
quite normal people and not monsters as
portrayed by the press. Naturally, at first
the ladies fainted away. But after much
persuasion, and being assured of a bodyguard,
they ventured upon entering their
husbands’ offices and watched the doings of
the German soldiers. The news of the visit
got about, and silently our male choir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
assembled under the windows and warbled
forth its finest songs. I am told that the
ladies were so deeply moved that they were
unable to speak, and could not hold back
bitter tears. From thence onwards they
often came and showed much kindness to
our men.</p>

<p>Another story also is very typical.</p>

<p>A new Colonel came to the camp. On his
first round he was armed to the teeth, and
walked about between two soldiers with
fixed bayonets, one in front and the other
behind him. When he met the Major and
the Captain, absolutely unarmed and unaccompanied,
he reproached them severely
for their carelessness.</p>

<p>But he soon improved.</p>

<p>One day this new Commandant sent for
these two gentlemen, and said to them in a
tone full of horror:</p>

<p>“Can you imagine this? We have been
sent some new prisoners, and it has been
reported that they are full of lice! Such
dreadful things can only happen to the
Germans.”</p>

<p>Captain Mitchell turned calmly to the
Major:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you remember, Owen, that we were
so covered with lice during our last campaign
that we simply could not move?”</p>

<p>The Colonel was aghast. I must point
out that though the Colonel <i>was</i> a Colonel
he had never in his life had anything to do
with military affairs. But that can only
happen in England!</p>

<p>About the end of March I at last received
news from my people. It was nearly nine
months since I had heard from them. It
is easy to picture my feelings when I held
in my hands my first letter from home,
hesitating to open it, for all my brothers and
male relatives had been at the Front since
July 1914. It informed me that they were
still safe; but, on the other hand, my beloved
little sister, my best pal, had died from the
effects of the war.</p>

<p>Towards the end of March the order came
that I should be recognized as an officer, and
transferred to an officers’ camp. My small
bundle and my hockey-stick were soon
collected, and after a warm farewell to my
comrades I marched to the station with
Major Owen.</p>

<p>I found the fine tact of the old gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
a very particular blessing. After a journey
that lasted several hours we reached Maidenhead,
near London, where I was received
by another English officer. And here, oh,
miracle, I also met dear old friends. Five
shining gold coins which had been taken
from the locksmith, Ernst Suse, were handed
over to my new companion, and the latter
was able to return them at once to me, as I
was an officer once more. Oh, the joy of
our reunion! A motor-car took us to the
Officers’ Camp, Holyport. The sentries presented
arms, the wire fences were opened,
and I found myself in the midst of a joyous
crowd of comrades. Who could have
imagined this change!</p>

<p>I again met those I had last seen at
Kiao-Chow&mdash;the victors of Coronel, the few
gallant survivors of the Falkland Islands.
It is impossible to imagine our joy. The
questions and answers! the excitement!
And then the miraculous happened, for I
was conducted to my dormitory, and there
I actually saw six or eight beds, made up
with white, clean sheets. I had been a
prisoner for eight weeks, and these were the
first beds I beheld. Can one understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the shy reverence with which I laid myself
to rest that night?</p>

<p>In the beginning, I thought myself in
Paradise, the more so as I was again being
treated as a human being. I was once more
amongst my comrades, and found my old
friends, and was greatly stimulated thereby.</p>

<p>The treatment in the camp was good.
The English Commandant was a sensible
man, who tried to ease our existence. The
building was an old military school, and
100 officers were imprisoned in the camp&mdash;eight
to ten shared a dormitory, which was
at the same time a sitting-room. Apart
from this, there was a number of mess,
reading and dining-rooms, in which we
spent most of our time when we were
not in the fresh air. The food was purely
English, therefore hardly palatable to the
majority of the Germans, but more than
sufficient and of good quality. At the
beginning we managed our own mess; but
this, unfortunately, was forbidden later on
by the War Office. During the day we
were left comparatively alone. We were
allowed to move freely among the buildings,
and in the garden. At ten in the morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
there was roll-call, and at ten in the evening
“lights out” and rounds.</p>

<p>Of course we were not allowed to approach
the barbed-wire entanglements which surrounded
the whole place, and which were
strictly guarded and illuminated night and
day. Twice a day the gates were opened,
and we passed between a lane of English
soldiers to the sports ground, which lay
about 200 yards away. Our games were
wonderfully organized. Two splendid football,
and, above all, some perfect hockey-fields,
stood at our disposal, and we displayed
such amazing form that even the English
were impressed. It is superfluous to add
that these fields were also surrounded by
barbed wire and sentries.</p>

<p>A very pleasant feature was the bi-weekly
appearance of an excellent tailor, and also
of a haberdasher, who provided us with
excellent hosiery and gave us the opportunity
of renewing our wardrobe.</p>

<p>Our monthly pay amounted to 120 marks,
of which sixty was put aside for our keep.
We were permitted to spend the rest; also to
receive money from home. The post worked
without a hitch. Letters from Germany,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
as well as parcels, took from six to eight
days, and arrived regularly. Conditions
were less fortunate in regard to our own
correspondence. Our weekly allowance consisted
of two short notes, and how gladly
would we have filled reams to our dearest
at home! The post was the Alpha and
Omega of our existence. We divided our
whole day according to its delivery, and the
temper of the camp was regulated by it.</p>

<p>Every morning saw the same spectacle.
When the interpreter arrived with the letters
everything was abandoned and forgotten.
The English officer was surrounded by a
silent crowd of waiting people. Each one’s
heart was filled with the burning wish to
receive some token, some loving message
from home. What joy when one’s hopes
were fulfilled, how great the sorrow and
disappointment when they were shattered.
In the latter case, we always said: “One
more day lost.” When, two months afterwards,
I was back in Germany, and was
asked on many sides what one could do to
give pleasure to the prisoners, I always said:
“Write, write as much as you can. What
the prisoner longs for most are letters.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>We lived in very close comradeship. In
the evenings we sat in groups round the
beautiful, large fireplaces, in which burned
huge logs of wood. The conversation touched
upon battles and victories, sorrow and death,
and wild, adventurous happenings. We had
many good books, and a string quartette as
well as a choir added much to our entertainment.</p>

<p>We played many a joke, and when we had
had a jolly good laugh we felt relieved for
a time from the terrible oppression which
captivity exercised on our spirits.</p>

<p>At the end of April our quiet existence
was suddenly broken up.</p>

<p>One evening the order was received to
transfer fifty officers to the Officers’ Camp
at Donington Hall. Excitement ran high,
for no one wanted to leave; but neither
entreaties nor opposition prevailed. We
had to pack our trunks and march off. I
was the only naval officer of the party, and
that, unfortunately, because the English
Commandant of the camp considered the
proximity of London too dangerous a temptation
for me. My devoted friend, Siebel, an
army flying-officer, followed me, so at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
we two of the same service remained
together.</p>

<p>On the 1st of May, therefore, we moved off
again. Motor-cars took us to Maidenhead
Station, where two reserved carriages were
waiting for us. We remained undisturbed
in our compartments; but the carriages
themselves were strictly guarded.</p>

<p>For many hours we rolled northwards.
At the stations people looked into our
windows curiously, but preserved a quiet
demeanour. Sometimes an old woman,
probably a suffragette, put out her unlovely
tongue at us. At last in the afternoon we
reached the station, Donington Castle, near
Derby, where we had to fall in in squads.
Guarded by sixty or seventy soldiers, we
were marched off on the order “Quick
march.”</p>

<p>Outside the station we were greeted by a
howling mob, composed of women and undersized
lads and children, but few men. In
France many of us had been accustomed to
this undignified behaviour of the populace,
but in England it was a new experience.
The women and the girls, belonging to the
lower classes, behaved like savages. Yelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
and whistling, they ran alongside and behind
us, and occasionally a stone or a lump of
dirt hurtled through the air. But the
majority were splitting with laughter and
seemed to enjoy their antics tremendously.
At the first turning a car came hooting
behind us. At the wheel sat our Interpreter-officer,
Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;, a fat and supercilious
individual, whom we were to know exhaustively
later on. Mr. M&mdash;&mdash; was out
to create an impression, and he at once
proceeded to do so by running over one of
his own soldiers, who belonged to our
escort. General uproar followed, in which
every one took part. Lastly, two of our
“Huns” sprang forward and rescued the
unfortunate Tommy from under the wheels.
Thereupon the fury of the women turned
upon Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;, who would have had a
poor time of it if he had not speedily driven
off. It is most regrettable that he was able
to do so! However, this incident was
quickly forgotten, and the crowd went on
yelling. It became more and more unruly
and dirt more and more plentiful, when
suddenly four or five cows, placidly chewing,
came ambling along and tried to pass us on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
both sides. What followed was so comical
that we, as well as our Tommies, stood still
and roared with laughter. On beholding
the peaceful cows the brave Amazons
shrieked despairingly, gathered up their
skirts and ran! Ruthlessly the strong
trampled on the weak, and in the twinkling
of an eye a confused mass of women lay
screaming and kicking in the ditches on
both sides of the road.</p>

<p>After that we were left in peace and were
allowed to proceed rapidly on our way.</p>

<p>All the time I sharply scrutinized our
surroundings and noted different landmarks,
which might possibly prove useful some day.</p>

<p>The sun burned down on us unmercifully,
and we were bathed in perspiration when we
at last reached our new home&mdash;Donington
Hall.</p>

<p>Discipline held sway there.</p>

<p>The portals and wire fences opened before
us; the whole guard turned out and presented
arms; the Officer in Command and
two Lieutenants stood at the right wing,
their hands raised in salute.</p>

<p>After we had been received by the Camp
Commandant, we were distributed over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
rooms, and I was lucky enough to secure,
with four other comrades, amongst whom
was my <i>fidus Achates</i> Siebel, a very nice
little den.</p>

<p>Here, also, I met a large number of
old friends. Some of the survivors of the
<i>Blücher</i>, some from torpedo-boat destroyers
and small cruisers, and several flying-men
from the Army and Navy.</p>

<p>Donington Hall was the model prisoners’
camp of England. To go by all we had read
about it for weeks in English papers it
should have been Paradise. Daily, long-winded
columns abused the Government for
the luxury with which the German officers
were housed. As usually happens, the
strongest attacks were launched by women,
and they even turned our ejection from
Donington Hall into a feminist issue. Even
Parliament had to take up this matter repeatedly.
It was rumoured that the place
was lavishly furnished, that we had several
entertainment and billiard rooms, a private
deer park; and even indulged in fox hunts,
especially got up for our benefit.</p>

<p>None of this was true. Donington Hall
was a large, old castle dating from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
seventeenth century, surrounded by a lovely
old park; but its rooms were completely
bare, and its accommodation as primitive
and scanty as possible. There was no trace
of the other items&mdash;entertainment-rooms or
hunting. After our arrival the inmates
numbered 120, and we were packed together
like pickled herrings. One cannot imagine
what would have happened if the camp had
held its full complement&mdash;400 to 500 officers&mdash;as
our mess, kitchens and bathrooms, etc.,
were far from sufficient even as it was.</p>

<p>We loved the beautiful park most. Our
residence was divided into two zones&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
in the so-called day and night boundaries.
These areas were marked off by huge erections
of barbed wire, which were partly
charged with electricity, illuminated at night
by powerful arc-lamps, and guarded sharply
by sentries both day and night.</p>

<p>At six in the evening, after the principal
roll-call, the day-boundary was closed, and
only reopened the next day at eight. Life
at Donington Hall was practically the same
as at Holyport, with the difference that,
thanks to the park, we had greater liberty
of movement, could indulge in more sport,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
and had three tennis-courts. The food here
also was English, so that many did not like
it; but it was very good. The English
Colonel was reasonable, and, although he
often grumbled, and was at times rather
inclined to make us feel his authority, he
was a distinguished, intelligent man, and a
perfect soldier, and that was the principal
thing. He did all that lay in his power to
lighten our hard lot, and took a special
interest in our sports&mdash;which was all to the
good.</p>

<p>He had a most obnoxious substitute in the
person of the interpreter, Lieutenant M&mdash;&mdash;,
the motorist, who was a worthy counterpart
of my friend M&mdash;&mdash; of the <i>Andania</i>&mdash;not
only “temporary Lieutenant,” but also
“temporary gentleman.” His family came
from Frankfurt-on-the-Main; he was director
of a strolling troupe before the war, and he
did nothing to disguise his base disposition.
I believe the English Colonel regarded him
with the utmost contempt, and the English
sergeants, with whom we occasionally exchanged
a few words in the canteen, begged
us to believe that all English officers were
not like this Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>One evening, towards the end of June, we
had a delightful adventure. Outside the
barbed wire a herd of wild deer&mdash;roebucks
and fawns&mdash;used to assemble in their
hundreds, and ran about as tame as goats.</p>

<p>That evening, a darling little fawn, which
had lost its mother, ran past the wire fence,
and, attracted by our alluring calls, it cleverly
wriggled through the defences into the camp.
The fawn was surrounded and petted (the
huntsmen growled), and lastly it was carried
in triumph in the arms of a Lieutenant into
the batmen’s room, where we intended to
rear it.</p>

<p>God knows how M&mdash;&mdash; heard of it. At
any rate he sent for the German Camp
Adjutant, and said in a voice that shook
with anxiety:</p>

<p>“Lieutenant S., is it true that there is
an animal in the camp?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; an animal.”</p>

<p>“Has it come in through the wire entanglements?”</p>

<p>“Yes; it simply crept through.”</p>

<p>“Oh, this is dreadful!” remarked Mr.
M&mdash;&mdash;, and he seemed to lose his voice
altogether. “I must at once see the hole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
through which the big beast has crawled. I
am convinced that the German officers have
cut the wire in order to escape. The animal
must also be at once removed.”</p>

<p>And so it happened.</p>

<p>And&mdash;this is no joke&mdash;twenty men from
the guard with fixed bayonets were sent for.
The solitary German soldier with the innocent
tiny fawn was taken into their midst. On
the order “Quick march” the whole procession
moved to the inside door of the
fence. The latter was opened, the twenty
men with the German soldier and the fawn
stepped into the intervening space, the so-called
“lock,” the inner portal, was carefully
shut. Only then was the outer one opened,
the soldier liberated the fawn, and after that
the whole procession wended its way back.
Oh, Mr. M&mdash;&mdash; what a laughing stock you
made of yourself!</p>

<p>After that all the entanglements were
carefully examined, and, though it was impossible
to find the smallest cleft through
which a man could have crept, M&mdash;&mdash; could
not quiet down for days.</p>

<p>Apart from the post, the arrival of newspapers
represented the chief interest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
day. We were allowed to receive the <i>Times</i>
and the <i>Morning Post</i>, and, though they
were nearly exclusively filled with Entente
victories, we knew them so well after a
short time that we could read between the
lines, and were able to conjecture the real
state of affairs with approximate correctness.</p>

<p>But what rage in the newspapers at the
sinking of the <i>Lusitania</i>, and what anger
when the Russians had to retire&mdash;of course
only for strategic reasons! We had manufactured
for ourselves several huge maps of
the theatres of war, which were correct
even to the slightest details, and each
morning at eleven our “General Staff
Officers” were hard at work moving the
little flags. Often the English Colonel himself
stood in front of them and thoughtfully
shook his head.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE ESCAPE</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">IN time captivity became unbearable.
Nothing relieved my gloom&mdash;neither
letters, parcels forwarded from home
by loving hands, the company of my friends,
not even hockey, to which I devoted myself
so strenuously that in the evenings I used
to drop asleep, half-dead from fatigue.</p>

<p>It was all of no avail. At last the
prisoners’ disease&mdash;home-sickness&mdash;held me
in its grip, as it had held so many before
me. The apathy of most dreadful despair,
of entire hopelessness. Hopeless!</p>

<p>For hours I lay on the grass and stared
with wide opened eyes into the sky, and
my whole soul longed fiercely for the white
clouds above, to wander off with them to
the distant beloved country.</p>

<p>When an English airman soared quietly
and securely in the blue firmament, my
heart contracted with pain, and a wild,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
desperate longing set me shivering. My
condition grew steadily worse. I became
irritable and nervous, behaved brusquely
towards my comrades and deteriorated
visibly, both mentally and physically. This
was quite unreasonable on my part, for I
should have been satisfied that at least
I had seen something of the hostilities, and
had had many interesting experiences! So
many fell wounded into the enemy’s hands
during the very first days of the war;
but the most to be pitied were those who
had come from America at the beginning of
the war, forsaking all their goods and
chattels, all they held dear, to serve their
Fatherland, and had been made prisoners
through English treachery, before they had
had a chance of drawing the sword.</p>

<p>We were greatly depressed owing to our
being deprived of war news from German
sources, and, though we naturally gave no
credence to the lying reports of the English,
yet, after a while, we felt the oppression
of reading, week after week, nothing but
abuse of Germany, tidings of defeats, revolution
and famine over there. Uncertainty
was our worst trial, and the announcement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
of Italy’s mean betrayal hit us particularly
hard.</p>

<p>What triumph in the English papers!</p>

<p>At last I was no longer able to bear it.
Something had to be done if I were to be
saved from despair.</p>

<p>Day and night I planned, brooded, deliberated
how I could escape from this
miserable imprisonment. I had to act with
the greatest calm and caution if I hoped
to succeed.</p>

<p>For hours together I walked up and down
in front of different parts of the entanglements,
whilst I unostentatiously examined
every wire and every stake. For hours
together I lay in the grass in the vicinity of
some of those spots that seemed favourable,
feigning sleep. But all the time I was
closely watching every object and noting
the ways and habits of the different sentries.
I had already fixed upon the spot where I
had decided to climb the barbed wire. Now
the question remained how to make headway
after this obstacle had been overcome. We
possessed neither a map of England nor a
compass, no time-table, no means of assistance
of any kind. We were even ignorant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
of the exact location of Donington Hall.
I knew the road to Donington Castle, for I
had fixed it in my memory on the day of
our arrival. I had also heard through an
officer, who had been taken by car to Donington
Hall from Derby, that the latter lay
about 25 to 30 miles away to the north,
and that he had passed a long bridge before
the car turned into the village. Next I
made friends with a nice old English soldier,
whom I presented occasionally with a few
cigars, and invited to a glass of beer in the
canteen. After we had met several times
I asked him whether he did not find it very
tedious to be tied to Donington, and whether
he sometimes had a change?</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” he said, now and then he
cycled to Derby to the cinema.</p>

<p>“What! Derby?” said I. “But that is
too far for you. You are far too old for
that!”</p>

<p>“Too old? I? No, sir! You don’t
know an English Tommy if you can say
that. When I am on my bike, I can race
any young fellow, and in three to four hours
I am in Derby!”</p>

<p>I had learned enough for that day. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
next week I again met my old friend. We
exchanged greetings, and I pressed into
his hands a couple of cigars which I always
carried about with me, though I do not
smoke.</p>

<p>“Hallo, Tommy!” I began suddenly. “I
was talking yesterday with a brother officer.
I swore that Derby lies to the north of
us, and he insists that it is to the south.
If I win, you will get a good big jug of
beer.”</p>

<p>My friend’s eyes glistened joyously, and
he assured me on his sacred oath that I had
won, and that Derby most certainly lay to
the north of Donington Hall.</p>

<p>Now I knew.</p>

<p>And then and there I resolved to make
common cause with a Naval-officer, Oberleutnant
Trefftz, who knew England and
spoke English remarkably well.</p>

<p>The 4th of July 1915 had been chosen
for our escape. We had rehearsed it in
every detail and made all our preparations.</p>

<p>On the 4th of July, in the morning, we
reported ourselves sick.</p>

<p>At the morning roll-call, at ten o’clock,
our names were entered on the sick-list,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
and on its completion the orderly sergeant
came to our room and found us ill in bed.</p>

<p>Everything was working well.</p>

<p>With the afternoon came the decision.</p>

<p>About 4 p.m. I dressed, collected all
that I considered necessary for my flight,
ate several substantial buttered rolls, and
bade farewell to my comrades, especially
to my faithful friend Siebel, who, unfortunately,
I could not take with me as he was no
sailor and did not speak English.</p>

<p>A heavy storm was in progress, and rain
poured in torrents from grey skies. The
sentries stood wet and shivering in their
sentry-boxes, and therefore nobody paid
any attention when two officers decided to
walk about in the park, in spite of the
rain. The park contained a grotto, surrounded
by shrubs, from which one could
overlook its whole expanse and the barbed
wire, without oneself being seen.</p>

<p>This is where Trefftz and I crept in. We
took a hurried leave of Siebel, who covered
us with garden chairs, and we were alone.
From now onwards we were in the hands
of Providence, and it was to be hoped that
Fortune would not forsake us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>We waited in breathless suspense. Minutes
seemed like centuries, but slowly and
surely one hour passed after another,
until the turret-clock struck six in loud,
clear chimes. Our hearts thumped in
unison. We heard the bell ring for roll-call,
the command “Attention,” and then
the noisy closing of the day-boundary. We
hardly dared to breathe, expecting at any
moment to hear our names called out. It
was 6.30 and nothing had happened. A
weight slipped from our shoulders. Thank
God, the first act was a success. For
during roll-call our names had again
been reported on the sick-list and, as soon
as the officers were allowed to fall out, two
of our comrades raced back as swiftly as
they could through the back entrance and
occupied Trefftz’s bed and mine. Therefore,
when the sergeant arrived he was
able to account satisfactorily for the two
invalids. As everything was now in order,
the night-boundary was closed, as every
night, and even the sentries withdrawn from
the day-boundary. Thus we were left to
our own devices. The exceptionally heavy
rain proved a boon to us, for the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
soldiers generally indulged in all kinds of
frolic in the evenings, and we might have
easily been discovered.</p>

<p>The hours followed each other. We lay
in silence; sometimes we nudged each other
and nodded our heads joyfully at the thought
that up to now all had gone so smoothly.</p>

<p>At 10.30 p.m. our excitement came to a
head. We had to pass our second test.
We clearly heard the signal “Stand to,”
and from the open window of my former
room “The Watch on the Rhine” rang out
sonorously. It was the concerted signal
that all were on the alert.</p>

<p>The orderly officer, accompanied by a
sergeant, walked through all the rooms and
satisfied himself that no one was missing.
By observations carried on for weeks I had
made sure that the orderly officers always
chose the same route in order to return to
their quarters, after their rounds, by the
shortest way. So it was to-night. The
round began with the room from which
Trefftz was missing. Of course his bed
was already occupied by some one.</p>

<p>“All present?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right! Good-night, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>And so forth. As soon as the orderly
officer had turned the corner, two other
comrades ran in the opposite direction
and into my room, so that here also all
could be reported “present.”</p>

<p>It is difficult to conceive our excitement
and nervous tension whilst this was in progress.
We followed all the proceedings in
our minds, and when suddenly silence supervened
for an unconscionably lengthy period
we feared the worst. With ice-cold hands,
ears on the alert for the slightest sound, we
lay, hardly daring to breathe.</p>

<p>At last, at 11 p.m., a lusty cheer broke
the stillness. It was our concerted signal
that all was clear!</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="pch">BLACK NIGHTS ON THE THAMES</p>

<p class="drop-cap14">ALL was silent around us. The rain
ceased. The park lay wrapped in
darkness, and only the light of the
huge arc-lamps, which lit up the night-boundary,
streamed faintly towards us.
The dull sound of the sentries’ footsteps as
they paced up and down in front of their
boxes, and their calls to each other every
quarter of an hour, sounded uncanny in
the stillness. At midnight the guard was
changed, and I followed it with strained
attention. Upon this, the orderly officer
flashed his lamp over the day-boundary, and
at 12.30 a.m. quiet reigned again.</p>

<p>The moment for action had arrived. I
crept softly as a cat from my hiding-place,
through the park up to the barbed-wire
fence, to convince myself that no sentries
were about. When I saw that everything
was in order and had found the exact spot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
where we wanted to climb over, I crawled
back again to fetch Trefftz. Thereupon we
returned by the same way.</p>

<p>When we reached the fence, I gave Trefftz
my final instructions and handed him my
small bundle.</p>

<p>I was the first to climb over the fence,
which was about 9 feet high, and every
8 inches the wire was covered with long
spikes.</p>

<p>Wires charged with electricity were placed
2½ feet from the ground. A mere touch
would have sufficed to set in motion a system
of bells that would, of course, have given the
alarm to the whole camp. We wore leather
leggings as protection against the spikes;
round our knees we had wound puttees, and
we wore leather gloves.</p>

<p>But all these precautions were of no avail,
and we got badly scratched by the spikes.
However, they prevented us from slipping
and coming in contact with the electric
wires. I easily swung myself over the first
fence. Trefftz handed over our two bundles
and followed me with equal ease.</p>

<p>Next we were confronted by a wire obstacle,
3 feet high by 30 feet wide, contrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
according to the latest and most cunning
devices. We ran over it like cats. After
this we again came to a high barbed-wire
hedge, built on exactly the same lines as
the first, and also electrically charged. We
managed this too, except that I tore a piece
out of the seat of my trousers, which I had
to retrieve, in order to put it in again later.</p>

<p>But, thank God, we were over the boundary!</p>

<p>Trefftz and I clasped hands and looked at
each other in silence.</p>

<p>But now the chief difficulty began.
Cautiously we went forward in the darkness,
crossing a stream, climbing over a wall,
jumping into a deep ditch, and at last slunk
past the guard-house which stood at the
entrance to the camp. Only after that were
we in the open.</p>

<p>We ran without stopping along the wide
main road which led to Donington Castle.
After half an hour we stopped and took off
our leggings and gloves, which had been
slashed and torn by the wire. The palms of
our hands, our feet, to say nothing of other
parts of our body, were in a pretty condition.
The barbed wire left us souvenirs which
stung for weeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>We now opened our bundles, took out
civilian grey mackintoshes, and walked down
the road in high spirits as if we were coming
from a late entertainment. When Donington
Castle came in sight, we had to be particularly
careful. We had agreed upon all we would
do in case we met anyone.</p>

<p>Suddenly, just as we were turning into
the village, an English soldier came walking
towards us. Trefftz embraced me, drew me
towards him, and we behaved like a rollicking
pair of love-birds. The Englishman surveyed
us enviously, and went on his way, clicking
his tongue. Only then, something in the
stocky, undersized figure made me realize
that it was the sergeant-major of our camp!
We stepped out briskly, and after passing
the village we were favoured by chance,
and came upon the bridge about which we
had been told. But we were at once confronted
with a critical proposition. The
highway branched off here in three directions,
and it was impossible to get any farther
without knowledge of the road. At last, in
spite of the darkness, we discovered a sign-post&mdash;an
extreme rarity in England. Luckily
it was made of iron, and, when Trefftz had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
climbed it, he was able to feel with his fingers
the word “Derby” traced on it in raised
letters.</p>

<p>We now fell into a quick step, and, taking
our bearings by the Polar star, swung along
vigorously. Whenever we came across
pedestrians and cars, and especially when
the latter drove behind us, we hid in the
ditch and waited until the danger was past.
It was quite natural that we should surmise
the presence of a messenger of Nemesis,
ready to swoop down upon us, in any car
that came along. When we were hungry
we ate a little of the ham and chocolate we
had brought with us. Unfortunately, the
one was too salt and the other too sweet,
so that we were plagued by an unquenchable
thirst which soon became so unbearable that
we could hardly advance. Matters were
made worse as we had perspired freely
during our exertions, and now we could find
no better means of slaking our thirst than by
standing in the ditch and licking the raindrops
from the leaves, until we found a dirty
little pool, on which we threw ourselves with
avidity. And wasn’t it good!</p>

<p>Gradually dawn came. About four in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the morning, when we arrived within sight
of the first houses of Derby’s suburbs, the
sun rose in majestic splendour, like a crimson
ball on the horizon. We stood enraptured
by this glorious spectacle, and we again
shook hands and joyously waved to the sun.</p>

<p>For he came from Germany, straight from
our country; he had caught his red hues
from the red battlefields, and brought us
faithful messages from our beloved ones.
A good omen!</p>

<p>We now crept into a small garden and
made an elaborate toilet. A clothes brush
performed miracles, and a needle repaired
the damage done to my trousers. The
lack of shaving soap was remedied by spittle,
after which our poor faces were subjected
to the ministrations of a Gilette razor. We
each sported our solitary collar and tie,
leaving the brush as well as other unnecessary
impedimenta behind us. We entered Derby,
looking veritable “Knuts.”</p>

<p>Our luck endured, and not only did we
soon find the station where we separated
unobtrusively, but we also learned that the
next train for London was leaving in a
quarter of an hour. I took a third-class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
return ticket to Leicester and, armed with
a fat newspaper, boarded the train. At
Leicester I got out, took a ticket to London,
and when I entered the compartment I
discovered, sitting opposite me, a gentleman
clad in a grey overcoat, whom I must have
met previously, but of whom I naturally took
no notice. I believe his name began with a T.</p>

<p>About noon the train reached London.
When I passed the ticket collector I must
admit that I did not feel quite comfortable,
and that my hand shook a little. But
nothing happened, and after a few minutes
I was swallowed up in the vortex of the
capital.</p>

<p>It was extremely fortunate that I had
spent some time in London two years
previously, and knew my way about. I
visited four different restaurants in turn,
where I stilled my hunger by eating moderately
in each, so as to avoid comments
on my ravenous appetite. After that I
walked along the Thames, recalling all
the streets, bridges and landing-stages which
I knew of yore, and took special note
of the localities where neutral steamers
were moored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>I had fondly imagined that conditions
would be more favourable, and that I
should at once be able to find a boat. But
I now saw that all the wharves and the
majority of the neutral steamers were
strictly guarded, and lay in the middle of
the river. At this moment everything contributed
to my depression: the strange
surroundings, my insecurity at the start,
when I imagined that every one knew who I
was, and could guess that I had escaped
from Donington Hall; also the fatigue and
excitement of the night before, and the
feeling of utter loneliness in the immense,
inimical city. I had also failed to get
a newspaper with the shipping intelligence,
and this was a bitter disappointment.</p>

<p>Was it to be wondered at that at seven
o’clock in the evening I stood weary and
downcast on the steps of St. Paul’s Cathedral,
waiting for Trefftz? I waited until
nine, but no Trefftz appeared.</p>

<p>Convinced that Trefftz had already
managed his escape on a friendly steamer, I
dragged myself, totally exhausted, to Hyde
Park which, to my further discomfiture, I
found closed. What should I do now?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Where should I sleep? I could not stay
in the streets if I were to remain unnoticed,
and I did not dare go to an hotel as I had no
passport, which, even for English people,
had become compulsory, and without which
no hotel proprietor was allowed to receive
visitors.</p>

<p>In a miserable bar, which I had entered to
fortify myself, I was only able to get warm
stout and one piece of cake. Everything else
had been consumed, and when the bar closed
I was again on the street. I turned into an
aristocratic lane where beautiful mansions
were surrounded by carefully tended gardens.
I was hardly able to stand on my feet, and
at the first favourable moment I jumped
with quick decision over one of the garden
fences and hid myself in a thick box hedge,
only a foot away from the pavement.
It is difficult to describe my state of mind.
My pulses were hammering, and thoughts
raced wildly through my tired brain.
Wrapped in my mackintosh, I lay in my
hiding-place, stealthily&mdash;like a thief.</p>

<p>If anyone had found me here in this
dreadful situation&mdash;me, a German officer!
I felt like a criminal, and in my heart I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
firmly resolved never to disclose to anyone
the details of my despicable adventure.
Oh, had I known then where I should soon
have to hang about at night, and even find
nothing odd in it, I should have felt my
position less keenly!</p>

<p>After I had lain for about an hour in my
refuge, the French window of the house, leading
to a beautiful veranda, opened, and several
ladies and gentlemen in evening dress came
out to enjoy the coolness of the night. I
could see them and hear every word. Soon
the sounds of a piano mingled with those of a
splendid soprano voice, and the most wonderful
songs of Schubert overwhelmed my soul
with longing.</p>

<p>At last total exhaustion prevailed, and I
slept heavily, seeing in my mind the most
beautiful pictures of the future.</p>

<p>Next morning I was awakened by the
regular heavy tread of a policeman who
marched up and down the street, quite close
to where I lay, with the bright, warm rays of
the sun shining down upon me.</p>

<p>So after all I had overslept&mdash;it behoved
me to be careful. The policemen ambled
idiotically up and down without dreaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
of departure. At last fortune favoured me.
An enchanting little lady’s maid opened the
door, and hey presto! the policeman was
at her side, playfully conversing with the
pretty dear.</p>

<p>Without being seen by either, with a quick
motion I vaulted over the fence into the street.
It was already six o’clock, and Hyde Park was
just being opened. As the Underground was
not yet running, I went into the Park and
dropped full length on a bench, near to other
vagabonds who had made themselves comfortable
there. I then pulled my hat over
my face and slept profoundly until nine
o’clock.</p>

<p>With fresh strength and courage I entered
the Underground, and was carried to the
harbour area. In the Strand huge, yellow
posters attracted my attention, and who
can describe my astonishment when I read
on them, printed in big, fat letters, that:</p>

<p class="ph4 p1">(1) Mr. Trefftz had been recaptured
the evening before; (2) Mr.
Plüschow was still at large;
but that (3) the police were
already on his track.</p>

<p class="p1">The first and the third items were news;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
but I knew all about the second. I promptly
bought a newspaper, went into a tea-shop,
where I read with great interest the following
notice:</p>

<p class="pc1 mid">“<span class="smcap">Extra Late War Edition</span>
“HUNT FOR ESCAPED GERMAN
“<i>High-pitched Voice as a Clue</i></p>

<p class="p1">“Scotland Yard last night issued the following
amended description of Gunther
Plüschow, one of the German prisoners who
escaped from Donington Hall, Leicestershire,
on Monday:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">Height, 5 feet 5½ inches; weight,
135 lb.; complexion, fair; hair, blond;
eyes, blue; and tattoo marks: Chinese
dragon on left arm.</p>

<p class="p1">As already stated in the <i>Daily Chronicle</i>,
Plüschow’s companion, Trefftz, was recaptured
on Monday evening at Millwall Docks.
Both men are naval officers. An earlier
description stated that Plüschow is twenty-nine
years old. His voice is high-pitched.</p>

<p>“He is particularly smart and dapper in
appearance, has very good teeth, which he
shows somewhat prominently when talking or
smiling, is ‘very English in manner,’ and
knows this country well. He also knows
Japan well. He is quick and alert, both
mentally and physically, and speaks French
and English fluently and accurately. He was
dressed in a grey lounge suit or grey-and-yellow
mixture suit.”</p>

<p>Poor Trefftz! So they had got him! I
was clear in my mind as to what I was
going to do, and the warrant gave me some
valuable points. First, I had to get rid
of my mackintosh. I therefore went to
Blackfriars Station and left my overcoat
in the cloakroom. As I handed the
garment over, the clerk suddenly asked
me: “What is your name, sir?” This
question absolutely bowled me over, as I was
quite unprepared for it. With shaking
knees I asked: “Meinen?” (mine), answering
in German as I naturally presumed that
the man had guessed my identity.</p>

<p>“Oh, I see, Mr. Mine&mdash;M-i-n-e,” and he
handed me a receipt in the name of Mr.
Mine. It was a miracle that this official
had not noticed my terror, and I felt particularly
uncomfortable when I had to pass
the two policemen who stood on guard at
the station, and who scrutinized me sharply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>I had escaped in a dark blue suit which had
been made in Shanghai and worn in quick
succession by Messrs. Brown and Scott,
by the millionaire MacGarvin and then by
the locksmith, Ernst Suse, then again falling
on better days when donned by a German
naval officer, and now concluding its existence
on the body of the dock labourer, George
Mine. Under the coat I wore a blue
sailor’s jersey which a naval prisoner had
given to me at Donington Hall. In my
pocket I carried a tattered old sports cap,
a knife, a small looking-glass, a shaving-set,
a bit of string and two rags which represented
handkerchiefs. In addition, I was
the proud possessor of a fortune of 120
shillings which I had partly saved and partly
borrowed; but never, either then or later,
did I possess papers or passports of any
kind.</p>

<p>I now sought a quiet, solitary spot. My
beautiful soft hat fell accidentally into the
river from London Bridge; collar and tie
followed suit from another spot; a beautiful
gilt stud held my green shirt together. After
that a mixture of vaseline, bootblack and
coal dust turned my blond hair black and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
greasy; my hands soon looked as if they
had never made acquaintance with water;
and at last I wallowed in a coal heap until I
had turned into a perfect prototype of the
dock labourer on strike&mdash;George Mine.</p>

<p>In this guise it was quite impossible to
suspect me of being an officer, and “smart
and dapper” were the last words anyone
could have possibly applied to me. I think
that I played my part really well, and, after
I had surmounted my inner repulsion against
the filth of my surroundings, I felt safe for
the first time. I was in a position to represent
what I intended to be&mdash;a lazy, dirty
bargee, or a hand from a sailing ship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>For days I loafed about London, my cap set
jauntily at the back of my head, my jacket
open, showing my blue sweater and its one
ornament, the gilt stud, hands in pocket,
whistling and spitting, as is the custom of
sailors in ports all the world over. No one
suspected me, and my whole plan hinged on
this, for my only safeguard against discovery
lay in the exclusion of even the slightest suspicion
directed against myself. If anyone had
paid even passing attention to me, if a policeman
had asked me for my name, I could only
have given my own. Therefore, it was quite
superfluous that the warrants put such stress
on the tattoo marks on my arm as a clue to
my identity. If matters had got thus far,
it would have meant that the fight was over.</p>

<p>On the second morning I had colossal
luck! I sat on the top of a bus, and behind
me two business men were engaged in
animated conversation. Suddenly I caught
the words, “Dutch steamer&mdash;departure&mdash;Tilbury,”
and from that moment I listened
intently, trying to quell the joyful throbbings
of my heart. For these careless gentlemen
were recounting nothing less than the
momentous news of the sailing, each morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
at seven, of a fast Dutch steamer for
Flushing, which cast anchor off Tilbury
Docks every afternoon.</p>

<p>In the twinkling of an eye I was off the
bus. I rushed off to Blackfriars Station,
and an hour later was at Tilbury. It was
midday, and the workmen were streaming
into their public-houses. First I went down
to the river and reconnoitred; but my boat
had not yet arrived. As I still had some
time before me and felt very hungry, I went
into one of the numerous eating-houses specially
frequented by dock-labourers. In a
large room a hundred of them were gathered
around long tables, partaking of huge meals.
I followed their example, and, by putting
down 8d., received a plate heaped with
potatoes, vegetables and a large piece of
meat. After that I purchased a big glass
of stout from the bar, and, sitting down
amongst the men with the utmost unconcern,
proceeded with my dinner, endeavouring
to copy the table manners of the
men around me, and nearly coming to grief
when trying to assimilate peas with the help
of a knife.</p>

<p>In the midst of my feast I suddenly felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
a tap on the shoulder. Icy shivers ran down
my back. The proprietor stood behind me
and asked me for my papers. I naturally
understood that he meant my identity book,
and gave all up as lost. As I was unable
to produce them, I was obliged to follow
him, and saw to my dread that he went to
the telephone. I was already casting furtive
glances at the door and thinking how I could
best make my escape, when the publican, who
had been watching me through the glass door,
returned and remarked: “If you have forgotten
your papers, I can’t help you. By the
by, what is your name? And where do you
come from?”</p>

<p>“I am George Mine, an American, ordinary
seaman from the four-masted barque
<i>Ohio</i>, lying upstream. I just came in here
and have paid for my dinner, but of course
haven’t got my papers about me.”</p>

<p>He remarked: “This is a private, social-democratic
club, and only members are
allowed to eat here&mdash;you ought surely to
know that&mdash;but if you become a member,
you are welcome to come as often as you
like.”</p>

<p>Of course I agreed at once to his proposal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
and paid three shillings’ entrance fee. A
bit of glaring red ribbon was passed through
my buttonhole, and thus I became the
latest member of the social-democratic trades
union of Tilbury!</p>

<p>I returned to my table as if nothing had
happened, gulped down my stout to fortify
myself after the shock I had just had, but
also soon left, for, to be quite frank, I had
lost all my appetite and no longer cared for
my food.</p>

<p>I now went down to the riverside, threw
myself on to the grass, and, feigning sleep,
kept a lynx-eyed watch.</p>

<p>Ship after ship went by, and my expectations
rose every minute. At last, at 4 p.m.,
with proud bearing, the fast Dutch steamer
dropped anchor and made fast to a buoy
just in front of me. My happiness and my
joy were indescribable when I read the
ship’s name in white shining letters on the
bow: <span class="smcap">Mecklenburg</span>.</p>

<p>There could be no better omen for me,
since I am a native of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.
I crossed over to Gravesend on a ferry-boat,
and from there unobtrusively watched the
steamer. I adopted the careless demeanour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
and rolling gait of the typical Jack Tar,
hands in my pockets, whistling a gay tune,
but keeping eyes and mind keenly on the
alert.</p>

<p>This was my plan: to swim to the buoy
during the night, climb the hawser, creep
on deck and reach Holland as a stowaway.</p>

<p>I soon found the basis for my operations.</p>

<p>After I had ascertained that nobody was
paying attention to me, I climbed over a
pile of wood and rubbish, and concealed
myself under some planks, where I discovered
several bundles of hay. These afforded me
a warm resting-place, of which I made use
on that and the following nights.</p>

<p>About midnight I left my refuge. Cautiously
I clambered over the old planks and
the litter strewn over the ground. The
rain came down noisily, and, though I had
taken my bearings during the day, it was
almost impossible in the pitch-dark night
to find the two barges which I had seen
near the lumber pile.</p>

<p>Creeping on all fours, listening with straining
ears and trying to pierce the surrounding
blackness, I came closer to my object.</p>

<p>However, I perceived with dismay that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the two barges which, in daytime, had been
completely submerged, lay high and dry.
Luckily, at the stern, a little dinghy rode
on the water.</p>

<p>With prompt resolution I wanted to rush
into the boat, but before I knew where I
was I felt the ground slipping from under
my feet and I sank to the hips into a squashy,
slimy, stinking mass. I threw my arms
about, and was just able to reach the plank,
which ran from the shore to the sailing-boat,
with my left hand.</p>

<p>It took all my strength to get free of the
slime which had nearly proved my undoing,
and I was completely exhausted when I at
last dragged myself back to my bed of hay.</p>

<p>When the sun rose on the third morning
of my escape, I had already returned to a
bench in Gravesend Park, and was watching
the <i>Mecklenburg</i> as she slipped her moorings
at 7 a.m. and made for the open sea.</p>

<p>All that day, as well as later on, I loafed
about London. For hours, like so many
other wastrels, I watched from the bridges
the position of the neutral steamers, the
loading and unloading of cargoes, noting
their stage and progress, in order, if possible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
to take advantage of a lucky moment to
slip on board.</p>

<p>I fed all these days in some of the worst
eating-houses of the East End. I looked so
disreputable and dirty, often limping or
reeling about like a drunkard, and put on
such an imbecile stare that no one bothered
about me. I avoided speech, and sharply
observed the workmen’s pronunciation and
the way in which they ordered their food.
Soon I had acquired such facility and quickness&mdash;to
say nothing of amazing impudence&mdash;that
I no longer even considered the
possibility of being caught. In the evening
I returned to Gravesend.</p>

<p>This time a new steamer lay at anchor in
the river, the <i>Princess Juliana</i>.</p>

<p>I now proceeded to pay still more attention
to the conformation of the riverside, so as to
safeguard myself against further accidents.</p>

<p>At midnight I found myself at the spot
I had chosen. The bank was stony and
the tide just going out. I quietly discarded
my jacket, boots and stockings,
stowed the latter, with my watch, shaving-set,
etc., in my cap, and put it on, fastening
it securely on my head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>After that I hid the jacket and the boots
under a stone, tightened the leather belt
which held my trousers, and, dressed as I
was, slipped gently into the water and swam
in the direction of the boat.</p>

<p>The night was rainy and dark. Soon I
was unable to recognize the shore which I
had just left, but could just make out the
outline of a rowing-boat which lay at anchor.
I made for it, but in spite of terrible exertions
could not get any nearer. My clothes were
soaked through, and, growing heavier and
heavier, nearly dragged me down. My
strength began to abandon me, and so
strong was the current that other rowing-boats
which lay at anchor seemed to shoot
past me like phantoms. Swimming desperately
and exerting all my strength, I tried
to keep my head above the water.</p>

<p>Soon, though, I lost consciousness, but
when I recovered it, I lay high and dry on
some flat stones covered with seaweed.</p>

<p>A kind fate had directed me to the few
stony tracts of the shore where the river
makes a sharp bend, and, thanks to the
quickly outflowing tide, I lay out of the water.</p>

<p>Trembling and shivering with cold and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
exertion, I staggered along the river-bank,
and after an hour I found my jacket and
my boots. After that I climbed over my
fence and lay down, with chattering teeth,
on my couch of straw.</p>

<p>It was still pouring, and an icy wind swept
over me. My only covering consisted of my
wet jacket and my two hands, which I
spread out protectively over my stomach
so as to try at least to keep well and going
for the next few days. After two hours,
being quite unable to sleep, I got up and
ran about to get a little warmer.</p>

<p>My wet clothes only dried when they had
hung over a stove a few days later in
Germany! I again went to London for the
day. I hung around in several churches,
where I probably created the impression
that I was praying devoutly; in reality I
enjoyed an occasional nap there.</p>

<p class="p1">“By the Chinese dragon clue the authorities
still hope to trace Lieutenant Gunther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Plüschow, of the German Navy, who escaped
from Donington Hall on Monday. The
dragon is tattooed on the fugitive’s left
arm in Oriental colours. It was probably
worked by a native artist, for although
but twenty-nine years of age, Plüschow has
had an adventurous career in the Kaiser’s
Navy.</p>

<p>“He was in Tsing-Tao when the British and
Japanese besieged that German fortress.
Shortly before it fell, Plüschow escaped in
an aeroplane, and some weeks later he was
found on board a Japanese trading ship at
Gibraltar.</p>

<p>“He will probably endeavour to sign on as
a seaman in a neutral ship sailing from a
British port, and, with this in view, a very
careful watch is being kept at all ports
throughout the country. Plüschow is a
typical sailor, about 5 feet 6 inches in height,
with fair hair and fresh complexion. He
would pass for a Dutchman with his broken
English. Nothing he can do can remove
the Chinese dragon from his left arm, and
his recapture should be but a matter of
time.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">On that day I nearly became an English
soldier. On one of the platforms, erected
in the midst of a public square, I saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
an orator standing up and addressing the
people&mdash;of course, angling for recruits. In
the most brilliant colours, and with the
highest enthusiasm, he depicted to the
attentive crowd the <i>entrée</i> into London of
victorious German troops. “The streets of
London,” he said, “will re-echo to the
tread of the ‘Huns’; your wives will be
ravished by German soldiers and trampled
on by their muddy boots. Will you allow
this, free Britons?” An indignant “No”
sounded back. “Very well, then&mdash;come
and join the army now!”</p>

<p>I expected a general rush forward, for the
man had spoken most impressively; but no
one budged, no one volunteered, or believed
that Kitchener specially wanted <i>him</i>. The
orator now started all over again, but his
flaming words fell on deaf ears.</p>

<p>In the meantime, English recruiting
sergeants moved about the crowd. Everywhere
people shook their heads. Not one
of Albion’s valorous sons was having any.
Suddenly my turn came.</p>

<p>A sergeant as tall as a lamp-post stood
before me and felt the biceps of my forearms.
He seemed very pleased with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
examination, for he tried to convince me
by all the means in his power that to be a
soldier in Kitchener’s army was the most
beautiful thing in the world. I refused.
“No,” I said; “it is quite impossible. I am
only seventeen.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that don’t matter; we shall simply
turn it into eighteen, and that’ll be all right.”</p>

<p>“No, really, it’s quite impossible. Moreover,
I am an American, and have no permission
from my Captain.” The persistent
fellow now produced an oleograph on which
the English uniforms were depicted in the
gaudiest colours. He simply would not let
me go. To get rid of him I asked him to
leave it with me, and promised to talk it over
with my skipper, and to tell him next day
which uniform I preferred. It goes without
saying that I always made a great detour
round this place.</p>

<p>I had by then acquired so much confidence
that I walked into the British
Museum, visited several picture-galleries
and even frequented matinées at music-halls,
without being asked questions. The pretty
blonde attendants at the music-halls were
especially friendly to me, and seemed to pity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the poor sailor who had wandered in by
chance. What amused me most was to see
the glances of disgust and contempt which
the ladies and the young girls used to
throw at me on the top of the buses. If
they had known who sat near them! Is it
surprising that I should not smell sweetly
considering my night’s work and the wet
and slimy state of my clothes? In the evening
I was back at Gravesend. In the little
park which overlooked the Thames I
listened quietly for hours to the strains of
a military band. I had definitely given up
my plan to swim to the steamer, for I saw
that the distance was too great and the
current too strong. I decided, therefore,
to commandeer unobtrusively, somehow, a
dinghy in which to reach the steamer.
Just in front of me I saw one which I deemed
suitable for my purpose, but it was moored
to a wharf over which a sentry stood guard
by day and night. But the risk had to be
taken. The night was very dark when,
about 12, I crept through the park and
crawled up to the embankment wall, which
was about 6 feet high. I jumped over the
hedge and saw the boat rocking gently on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
the water. I listened breathlessly. The
sentry marched up and down. Half asleep,
I had taken off my boots, fastening them
with the laces round my neck, and holding
an open knife between my teeth. With the
stealth of an Indian I let myself down over
the wall, and was just able to reach the gunwale
of the boat with my toes. My hands
slipped over the hard granite without a
sound, and a second later I dropped into the
boat, where I huddled in a corner listening
with breathless attention; but my sentry went
on striding up and down undisturbed under
the bright arc-lamps. My boat, luckily, lay
in shadow.</p>

<p>My eyes, trained through T.B.D. practice,
saw in spite of the pitch darkness almost as
well as by day. Carefully I felt for the oars.
Damn! They were padlocked! Luckily the
chain lay loose, and silently I first freed the
boat-hook, then one oar after the other from
the chain. My knife now sawed through the
two ropes which held the boat to the wall,
and I dipped my oars noiselessly into the
water and impelled my little boat forward.</p>

<p>When I had entered the boat, it had
already shipped a good deal of water. Now I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
noticed to my dismay that the water was
rapidly rising. It was already lapping the
thwart, and the boat became more and more
difficult to handle as it grew heavier and
heavier. I threw myself despairingly on my
oars. Suddenly, with a grinding noise, the
keel grounded and the boat lay immovable.
Nothing now was of avail, neither pulling
nor rowing, nor the use of the boat-hook.
The boat simply refused to budge. Very
quickly the water sank round it, and after
a few minutes I sat dry in the mud, but
to make up for this the boat was brimful
of water. I had never in my life witnessed
such a change in the water-level due to the
tide. Although the Thames is well known in
this respect, I had never believed that possible.</p>

<p>At this moment I found myself in the
most critical position of my escape. I was
surrounded on all sides by slushy, stinking
slime, whose acquaintance I had made two
evenings before at the risk of my life. The
very thought caused me to shudder. About
200 yards off the sentry marched up and
down, and I found myself with my boat 15
feet from the 6-foot-high granite wall.</p>

<p>I sat reflecting coolly. One thing appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
a sheer necessity&mdash;not to be found
there by the English, who might have
killed me like a mad dog.</p>

<p>But the water was not due to rise before
the next afternoon. Therefore it behoved
me to muster my energy, clench my teeth,
and try to get the better of the mud. I
slipped off my stockings, turned up my
trousers as high as I could, then I placed
the thwarts and the oars close to each other
on the seething and gurgling ooze, used
the boat-hook as a leaping-pole by placing
its point on a board, stood on the gunwale,
and, gathering all my strength to a mighty
effort, I vaulted into space&mdash;but lay, alas,
the next moment 3 feet short of the wall,
and sank deep over knee into the clammy
slush, touching hard bottom, however, as
I did so. Now I worked myself along the
wall, placed my boat-hook as a climbing-pole
against it, and found myself in a few seconds
on top, after which I slid into the grass of
the park, where a few hours previously I
had been listening to the music. Unbroken
silence reigned around me. Unutterable
relief flooded me, for nobody, not even the
sentry, had noticed anything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>With acute discomfort I contemplated my
legs. They were covered with a thick,
grey, malodorous mass, and there was no
water in the vicinity to clean them. But it
was impossible to put on boots or stockings
whilst they were in that condition. With
infinite trouble I succeeded in scraping off
the dirt as far as possible, and waited for
the rest to dry; then only was I able to
resume a fairly decent appearance.</p>

<p>My first plan had miscarried, but in spite
of this I felt I had had such luck with it
that I was ready to undertake a second
venture.</p>

<p>I now made my way to the little bridge,
which was guarded by my sentry, and,
impersonating a drunken sailor, I reeled
about until I gently collided with the good
fellow. He, however, seemed quite used to
such happenings, for remarking pleasantly,
“Hallo, old Jack! One whisky too much!”
he patted me on the shoulder and let me pass.</p>

<p>A hundred yards farther on, and I had
regained my normal demeanour. After a
short search I found the place from which
I had started the night before on my ill-starred
swimming attempt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>It was about 2 a.m., and in a trice I had
undressed and sprang, agile and unhampered&mdash;as God
had made me&mdash;into the water. For
the first time the sky was covered with clouds,
and the outlines of rowing-boats, anchored
at a distance of about 200 yards from the
shore, appeared vague and shadowy. The
water was quite unusually phosphorescent,
and I have only observed it to that degree
in the tropics. I swam, therefore, in a sea
of gold and silver. At any other time I
would have admired this play of Nature
immensely, but now I only felt fear that
my body would flash suspiciously white in
this clear golden light. At the start, all
went well. But as soon as I had passed
the left bend of the river, where the shore
afforded some protection, I was seized by
the current, and had to fight for my life
with the watery elements. As I was losing
my strength I reached the first boat, made
a final effort and hoisted myself noisily
into it. Oh, persecution of a pitiless fate!
The boat was empty&mdash;no scull, no boat-hook
with which I could have put it in
motion. After a short pause I again slipped
into the water and drifted on to the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
boat. And this, too, was empty! And
the same happened with the three next.
And when I reached the last one, after I
had rested a little, I again dipped into the
glittering but now unpleasantly cold water.
Two hours after I had started on my adventure,
I again reached the place where I had
left my clothes.</p>

<p>As I was trembling like an aspen leaf
with cold and exposure, I found it particularly
hard to get into my sodden and sticky togs.</p>

<p>Half an hour later I was back in my sleeping-place
amid the hay, beginning to feel
serious doubts in the existence of my lucky
star!</p>

<p>Could I be blamed if my spirits fell a
little, and if I became quite indifferent
to my interests? I confess I was so discouraged
that the next morning I did not
find sufficient energy to leave my hiding-place
in time, and only escaped over my
fence after the proprietor of the timber-pile
had passed close in front of my retreat
several times. That day I walked
up to London on foot from Gravesend, and
returned by the other side of the Thames to
Tilbury. All this, in order to find a boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
that I could purloin unnoticed. It was quite
incredible that I could not do so; several
lay there, as if waiting for me; but they
were only too well guarded. I gave it up
in despair.</p>

<p>That evening I went to a music-hall, with
the firm intention of blowing my last pound,
and then staking everything on one card,
and try to get to the docks and hide there
on a neutral steamer. And if this plan
miscarried&mdash;as it had with Trefftz&mdash;I decided
to give myself up to the police.</p>

<p>I stood in the upper gallery of the biggest
music-hall in London and watched the performance.
An inner voice whispered to me:
“Your place is at Gravesend, working for
your escape. Your duty is to throw off this
slackness, otherwise you are not worthy to
be a German sailor!”</p>

<p>So when I saw the <i>tableaux vivants</i>,
scenes from the trenches and allegories
of the coming Victory and Peace, in which
the Germans naturally figured as fleeing
and conquered, when at last, in the chief
picture, Britannia appeared&mdash;a shining
figure with the Palm of Victory in her hand,
and a field-grey German soldier lying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
prostrate beneath her right foot&mdash;I felt
consumed by a flame of righteous anger, and
in spite of the forcible protests of my neighbours
I fled from the theatre, and was able
to catch the last train to Tilbury.</p>

<p>Only then did I feel happy again. And I
felt so certain now that my plan would come
off, that no room was left for doubt.</p>

<p>After I had passed the first fishermen’s
huts of Gravesend, I found a small scull.
I took it with me. In mid-stream, just near
the landing-place of the fishing-vessels, a
little dinghy bobbed on the water. Not
more than twenty feet away sat their owners
on a bench, so absorbed in tender flirtation
with their fair ones that the good sea-folk
took no heed of my appearance on the
scene.</p>

<p>It was risky, but “Nothing venture,
nothing have,” I muttered to myself. And,
thanks to my acquired proficiency, I crept
soundlessly into the boat&mdash;one sharp cut,
and the tiny nutshell softly glided alongside
a fishing-boat, on whose quarter-deck a
woman was lulling her baby to sleep.</p>

<p>As there were no rowlocks in the boat, I sat
aft, and pushed off with all my strength from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the shore. I had, however, hardly covered
one-third of the distance, when the ebbtide
caught me in its whirl, spun my boat round
like a top and paralysed all my efforts at
steering. The time had come to show my
sailor’s efficiency. With an iron grip I
recovered control of the boat, and, floating
with the tide, I steered a downstream course.
A dangerous moment was at hand. An
imposing military pontoon-bridge, stretching
across the river, and guarded by soldiers,
came across my way. Summoning cool
resolution and sharp attention to my aid,
looking straight ahead and only intent
on my scull, I disregarded the sentry’s
challenge and shot through between the two
pontoons. A few seconds after the boat
sustained a heavy shock, and I floundered
on to the anchor-cable of a mighty coal-tender.
With lightning speed I flung my
painter round it, and this just in time, for
the boat nearly capsized. But I was safe.
The water whirled madly past it, as the
ebbtide, reinforced by the drop of the river,
must have fully set in. I had now only
to wait patiently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>My steamer lay to starboard. I wanted to
bide my time until the flow of the tide made
it possible for me to get across.</p>

<p>I was already bubbling over with cock-sureness
when the necessary damper was
administered. Dawn was breaking, the outlines
of the anchored ships became clearer
and clearer. At last the sun rose, and still
the water ran out so strongly that it was
impossible even to contemplate getting away.
Anyhow, it was impossible to carry out my
flight just then. But at last, happy in the
possession of the long-desired boat, I slid
downstream and, after an hour, pulled up
at a crumbling old bridge on the right
bank of the Thames. I pushed my boat
under it, took both sculls with me as a precautionary
measure, and hid them in the long
grass. Then I lay down close to them, and
at eight o’clock I saw my steamer, the
<i>Mecklenburg</i>, vanishing proudly before my
eyes. My patience had still to undergo
a severe test. I remained lying in the grass
for the next sixteen hours, until, at eight
o’clock that night, the hour of my deliverance
struck.</p>

<p>I again entered my boat. Cautiously I
allowed myself to be driven upstream by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the incoming tide, and fastened my boat to
the same coal-tender near which I had been
stranded the night before. Athwart to me
lay the <i>Princess Juliana</i> moored to her buoy.</p>

<p>As I had time to spare, I lay down at the
bottom of my boat and tried to take forty
winks, but in vain. The tide rose, and I was
once more surrounded by the rushing water.</p>

<p>At midnight all was still around me, and
when at one o’clock the boat was quietly
bobbing on the flow, I cast off, sat up in my
boat, and rowed, with as much self-possession
as if I had been one of a Sunday party in
Kiel Harbour, to the steamer.</p>

<p>Unnoticed, I reached the buoy. The black
hull of my steamer towered high above me.
A strong pull&mdash;and I was atop the buoy. I
now bade farewell to my faithful swan with a
sound kick, which set it off downstream with
the start of the ebb. During the next few
minutes I lay as silent as a mouse. Then I
climbed with iron composure&mdash;and this time
like a cat&mdash;the mighty steel cable to the hawse.
Cautiously I leaned my head over the rail and
spied about. The forecastle was empty.</p>

<p>I jerked myself upwards and stood on the
deck.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="pch">THE STOWAWAY</p>


<p class="drop-cap00">I NOW crept along the deck to the
capstan and hid in the oil save-all
beneath the windlass.</p>

<p class="pn">As all remained quiet, and not a soul hove
in sight, I climbed out of my nook, took off
my boots, and stowed them away under a
stack of timber in a corner of the fore-deck.
I now proceeded to investigate in my
stockinged feet. When I looked down from
a corner astern the fore-deck to the cargo-deck
I staggered back suddenly. Breathlessly,
but without turning a hair, I remained
leaning against the ventilator. Below, on
the cargo-deck, stood two sentries, who
were staring fixedly upwards.</p>

<p>After I had remained for over half an hour
in this cramped position, and my knees
were beginning to knock under, there tripped
two stewardesses from the middle-deck.
They were apparently coming off night duty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
My two sentries immediately seized the
golden moment, and became so absorbed
in their conversation that they no longer
paid any attention to what was going on
around them.</p>

<p>The dawn was breaking, and I had to act
at once if I was not to lose all I had achieved
at such a price.</p>

<p>I let myself down along the counter on
the side of the fore-deck opposite to the two
loving couples, and landed on the cargo-deck.
Without pausing for a moment I
stepped out gently, glided past the two
sentries, reached the promenade-deck safely,
and, climbing up a deck-pillar, found myself
shortly afterwards on the out-board side of
a life-boat.</p>

<p>Holding on with one hand with a grip of
iron, for the Thames was lapping hungrily
not 12 yards away, with my other, aided by
my teeth, I tore open a few of the tapes of
the boat-cover, and with a last output of
strength I crept through this small gap
and crouched, well hidden from curious eyes,
into the interior of the boat.</p>

<p>And then, naturally, I came to the
end of my endurance. The prodigious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
physical exertions, acute excitement, and
last, but not least, my ravenous hunger,
stretched me flat on the boards of the
boat, and in the same moment I no longer
knew what was going on around me.</p>

<p class="pch">THE WAY TO FREEDOM</p>

<p class="drop-cap07">SHRILL blasts from the siren woke me
from a sleep which in its dreamlessness
resembled death.</p>

<p class="pn">I prudently loosened the tapes of my boat-cover,
and with difficulty suppressed a
“Hurrah!” for the steamer was running
into the harbour of Flushing.</p>

<p>Nothing mattered any longer. I pulled
out my knife, and at one blow ripped open
the boat-cover from end to end; but this
time on the deck side.</p>

<p>With a deep breath, I stood in the middle
of the boat-deck, and expected to be made
a prisoner at any moment.</p>

<p>But no one bothered about me. The crew
was occupied with landing manœuvres; the
travellers with their luggage.</p>

<p>I now descended to the promenade-deck,
where several passengers eyed me with
indignation on account of my unkempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
appearance and my torn blue stockings,
which looked, I must say, anything but
dainty.</p>

<p>But my eyes must have been so radiantly
happy, and such joy depicted on my dirty,
emaciated features that many a woman
glanced at me with surprise.</p>

<p>I could no longer go about like this. I
therefore repaired to the fore-deck, fetched
my boots (my best hockey boots, kindly
gifts from the English), and, though a Dutch
sailor blew me up gruffly, I calmly put on
my beloved boots, and wandered off to the
gangway.</p>

<p>The steamer had made fast directly to
the pier.</p>

<p>The passengers left the ship, bidding farewell
to the Captain and the ship’s officers.
At first I had intended to make myself
known to the Captain, in order to avoid any
trouble to the Dutch Steamship Company.
But more prudent counsels prevailed, and
with my hands in my pockets, looking as
unobtrusive as I could, I slunk down the
gangway.</p>

<p>Nobody paid any attention to me, so I
pretended to belong to the ship’s crew, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
even helped to fasten the hawsers. Then
I mixed with the crowd, and whilst the
passengers were being subjected to a strict
control I looked round, and near the railings
discovered a door, on which stood in large
letters “Exit Forbidden.”</p>

<p>There, surely, lay the way to Freedom!
In the twinkling of an eye I negotiated this
childishly easy obstacle, and stood without.</p>

<p>I was free!</p>

<p>I had to make the greatest effort of my
life to keep myself from jumping about like
a madman. Two countrymen of mine gave
me a cordial welcome, though they would not
believe that I was an officer, and, above all
things, that I had achieved my escape from
England.</p>

<p>How horrible the water in my bath looked!</p>

<p>I also ate enough for three that night.</p>

<p>After I had bought a few small necessaries
on the next day, I boarded a slow train for
Germany, wearing workman’s clothes.</p>

<p>As the train was going to start, a man
came up behind me and tapped me on the
shoulder (how I did hate this manner of
greeting!) and asked me, “Where are your
papers?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who are you, anyway?” I said.</p>

<p>“I am Secret Service.”</p>

<p>“Anybody can say that.”</p>

<p>“Of course, sir; but here’s my badge.”</p>

<p>For a moment I felt dizzy. I explained
to this gentleman with great suavity that
I possessed no papers, that I was on my
way back to Germany, and that I should
give no trouble to the Dutch Government.</p>

<p>“So,” he remarked, “you come from
England, and you have no papers? I
suppose that was a bit difficult?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Rather!” I said.</p>

<p>“Well, I wish you a further pleasant
journey.”</p>

<p>We shook hands as the train moved off.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="pch">BACK IN THE FATHERLAND!</p>

<p class="drop-cap00">I WAS quite unable to sit still for long.
Alone in my first-class compartment I
was overwhelmed by the thoughts and
hopes which raced through my brain. I ran
about my railway carriage like a wild animal
in a cage.</p>

<p>At last! At last! It seemed an eternity;
the train passed slowly over the German
frontier.</p>

<p>The black-and-white post greeted my
eyes and, leaning out of the window, I joyfully
yelled “Hurrah!” twice.</p>

<p>But the third “Hurrah!” stuck in my
throat, as carried away by gratitude, happiness
and delight I sobbed aloud, and could
not prevent the tears gushing from my
eyes.</p>

<p>Was this sloppiness?</p>

<p>The train stopped at Goch. The first
“field-greys” I had ever seen in my life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
stood on the platform as I jumped carelessly
out of the train.</p>

<p>A harsh grip seized me by the collar, and
a huge Prussian cavalry sergeant-major, with
fierce eyes under a shining helmet, held me
in his iron fist.</p>

<p>“Ha! now we have got the young
scamp!”</p>

<p>I would gladly have fallen on my dear
“field-grey’s” neck, for never had I felt
safer in my life than at that moment.</p>

<p>I tried to explain who I was; but a smile
which would have boded but little consolation
to anyone else was all the answer
I got.</p>

<p>Two brave Landsturm veterans conducted
me to Wesel under arrest next morning.</p>

<p>No one was at the office yet to interview
me. Small boys had followed me, throwing
stones and shouting: “They have got him;
they have got him&mdash;the spy!” The darling
little blond heads!</p>

<p>An orderly received me!</p>

<p>“Sit down&mdash;you there. With people like
you we don’t lose much time. When the
Herr Kapitänleutnant F. arrives, just a short
examination&mdash;and up in the air you go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>After some little time the Redoubtable
One appeared&mdash;of course a comrade of
mine. Indescribable astonishment and joy!
But the stupid face of my amiable orderly
was good to behold. He had to run off
straight away and fetch my breakfast.</p>

<p>I derived special satisfaction while still
at Wesel from reading an English warrant
from the <i>Daily Mail</i>, dated 12th July, when
I was already safe, which ended by declaring
that I would probably try to escape
as a sailor on a neutral steamer and that:</p>

<p>“His recapture should be but a matter of
time.”</p>

<p>An hour later I sat, still in my workman’s
clothes, a passport in my pocket, in the
Berlin express&mdash;of course first class!</p>

<p>At last I had attained my goal! It had
taken me nearly nine months to break my
way through from Kiao-Chow to Germany.</p>

<p>Germany, oh, my beloved country! I
had come back to thee!</p>

<p>The sun was shining radiantly on the 13th
of July 1915, and my elated eyes were taking
in the lovely pictures of my countryside.</p>

<p>I had settled down alone in my first-class
carriage, and had spread my belongings on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
both sides of the window, and begun to jot
down my report in pencil.</p>

<p>At Münster an old General in full uniform
entered my compartment. I stood up
politely, cleared a seat, and said, “May I
most humbly place this seat at Your
Excellency’s disposal?”</p>

<p>A furious look from his hard eyes, an
outraged growl “Brrrr,” and the door
slammed to. I was alone.</p>

<p>If this little book should fall by chance
into His Excellency’s hands, may I be
forgiven that I forgot, when addressing
him, what clothes I was wearing at the
time.</p>

<p>At seven o’clock that evening the train
entered the Zoo Station.</p>

<p>A pair of wonderful blue eyes swimming
in tears, a gorgeous bunch of crimson roses,
and unable to utter a word through sheer
happiness and the joy of reunion we left the
station.</p>

<p>I passed the next days as in a dream.
When I entered the Admiralty, the porter
naturally would not allow me to come in;
and also in the large shops, where I had
to buy things in double-quick time, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
nothing was left me but my workman’s
attire, the commissionaires were bent on
ejecting me.</p>

<p>I only worked a few days at the Imperial
Naval Ministry, and then I received my
Emperor’s thanks.</p>

<p>And with the Iron Cross of the First Class
I proudly went home to my people.</p>

<p>After a few weeks’ rest I received my
greatest reward.</p>

<p>I became a “flying-man” again, and was
allowed to co-operate in the great work of
Germany’s fight and victory.</p>

<p>And when, at the Eastern Front, my
most gracious Emperor and Master inspected
the Naval Flying Station, under my command,
and shook hands with me and personally
expressed his Imperial satisfaction,
I looked straight into his eyes, and pressed
in burning letters graven in my heart stood:</p>

<p class="pc1 mid">“<span class="smcap">With God for Emperor and
Fatherland.</span>”</p>
